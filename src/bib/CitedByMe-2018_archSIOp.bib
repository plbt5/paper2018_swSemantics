abstract = {"Eric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design of your software match your mental model of the problem domain you are addressing. "His book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, the language you use to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your improving understanding of it. Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning, and so refactoring is a big part of his technique. "The book is a fun read. Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this book as essential reading for software developers--it is a future classic." --Ralph Johnson, author of Design Patterns "If you don''t think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented programming, this book will tell you what you''ve forgotten to do. "Eric Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the central focus of development and provides a solid framework and set of techniques for accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion." --Dave Collins, author of Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces "Eric weaves real-world experience modeling--and building--business applications into a practical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted practitioner, Eric''s descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle management, logical and physical application structuring, and the process and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to our field." --Luke Hohmann, author of Beyond Software Architecture "This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful software developer." --Kent Beck "What Eric has managed to capture is a part of the design process that experienced object designers have always used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in conveying to the rest of the industry. We''ve given away bits and pieces of this knowledge...but we''ve never organized and systematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is important." --Kyle Brown, author of Enterprise Java(tm) Programming with IBM�WebSphere� The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process. Domain-Driven Design fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include: Getting all team members to speak the same language Connecting model and implementation more deeply Sharpening key distinctions in a model Managing the lifecycle of a domain object Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways Making complex code obvious and predictable Formulating a domain vision statement Distilling the core of a complex domain Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model Applying analysis patterns Relating design patterns to the model Maintaining model integrity in a large system Dealing with coexisting models on the same project Organizing systems with large-scale structures Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.},

Following this approach, Software projects are no longer driven only by requirements and models but also by one or several ontology/ies covering their application domain. Our main thesis says that OBSE can offer similar opportunities and benefits for re-engineering and re-use in the early phases of software development as object orientation does for the later ones. OBSE is to be supported by tools which integrate ontologies in the SE process. A prototype of such a tool - based on the KCPM and EOS methodologies - is presently being developed in a joint project of our groups.},

@inproceedings{Atkinson2011,
abstract = {As an alternative modeling infrastructure and paradigm, multi-level modeling addresses many of the conceptual weaknesses found in the four level modeling infrastructure that underpins traditional modeling approaches like UML and EMF. It does this by explicitly distinguishing between linguistic and ontological forms of classification and by allowing the influence of classifiers to extend over more than one level of instantiation. Multi-level modeling is consequently starting to receive attention from a growing number of research groups. However, there has never been a concrete definition of a language designed from the ground-up for the specific purpose of representing multi-level models. Some authors have informally defined the ``look and feel'' of such a language, but to date there has been no systematic or fully elaborated definition of its concrete syntax. In this paper we address this problem by introducing the key elements of a language, known as the Level-Agnostic Modeling Language (LML) designed to support multi-level modeling.},

abstract = {The integration of information of different kinds, such as spatial and alphanumeric at different levels of detail, is a challenge. While a solution is not reached, it is widely recognized that the need to integrate information is so pressing that it does not matter if detail is lost, as long as integration is achieved. This paper shows the potential for information retrieval at different levels of granularity inside the framework of information systems based on ontologies. Ontologies are theories that use a specific vocabulary to describe entities, classes, properties and functions related to a certain view of the world. The use of an ontology, translated into an active information system component, leads to ontology-driven information systems and, in the specific case of GIS, leads to what we call ontology-driven geographic information systems.},

@book{Gärdenfors:2004vc,
abstract = {Within cognitive science, two approaches currently dominate the problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches. Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to present a coherent research program that can be used as a basis for more detailed investigations.},

abstract = {Software Engineering Environments (SEEs) are systems designed to support software development and maintenance, and also for supporting project control and management. They provide means to integrate developers with the software process and the supporting technology. Since during software development many information resources are produced and used, it is very important to add semantics to them in order to improve the assistance given by the environment. In this context, ontologies are a key enabling technology for Semantic SEEs (SSEEs). A SSEE can be viewed as a SEE in which part of the information handled has associated a formal meaning (semantics), augmenting its tools' ability to work in conjunction with each other and with human developers. This paper discusses how ontologies are used in ODE, an Ontology-based software Development Environment, to make it a SSEE.},

abstract = {In philosophy, the term ontology has been used since the 17th century to refer both to a philosophical discipline (Ontology with a capital “O”), and as a domain-independent system of categories that can be used in the conceptualization of domain-specific scientific theories. In the past decades there has been a growing interest in the subject of ontology in computer and information sciences. In the last few years, this interest has expanded considerably in the context of the Semantic Web and MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) research efforts, and due to the role ontologies are perceived to play in these initiatives. In this paper, we explore the relations between Ontology and ontologies in the philosophical sense with domain ontologies in computer science. Moreover, we elaborate on formal characterizations for the notions of ontology, conceptualization and metamodel, as well as on the relations between these notions. Additionally, we discuss a set of criteria that a modeling language should meet in order to be considered a suitable language to model phenomena in a given domain, and present a systematic framework for language evaluation and design. Furthermore, we argue for the importance of ontology in both philosophical senses aforementioned for designing and evaluating a suitable general ontology representation language, and we address the question whether the so-called Ontology Web languages can be considered as suitable general ontology representation languages. Finally, we motivate the need for two complementary classes of modeling languages in Ontology Engineering addressing two separate sets of concerns.},

abstract = {Graph rewriting (also called reduction) as defined in Wadsworth [t971] was introduced in order to be able to give a more efficient implementation of functional programming languages in the form of lambda calculus or term rewrite systems: identical subterms are shared using pointers. Several other authors, e.g. Ehrig [1979], Staples [1980a, b,c], Raoult [1984] and van den Broek et al. [1986] have given mathematical descriptions of graph rewriting, usually employing concepts from category theory. These papers prove among other things the correctness of graph rewriting in the form of the Church-Rosser property for "well-behaved" (i.e. regular) rewrite systems. However, only Staples has formally studied the soundness and completeness of graph rewriting with respect to term rewriting. In this paper we give a direct operational description of graph rewriting that avoids the category theoretic notions. We show that if a term t is interpreted as a graph g(t) and is reduced in the graph world, then the result represents an actual reduct of the original term t (soundness). For weakly regular term rewrite systems, there is also a completeness result: every normal form of a term t can be obtained from the graphical implementation. We also show completeness for all term rewrite systems which possess a so called hypernormalising strategy, and in that case the strategy also gives a normalising strategy for the graphical implementation. Besides having nice theoretical properties, weakly regular systems offer opportunities for parallelism, since redexes at different places can be executed independently or in parallel, without affecting the final result.},

abstract = {A true semantic web of data requires dynairtic, real-time interoperability between disparate data sources, developed by different organizations in different ways, each for their own specific purposes. Ontology languages provide a means to relate data items to each other in logically well-defined ways, producing complex logical structures with an underlying formal semantics. Whilst these structures have a logical formal semantics, they lack a pragmatic semantics linking them in a systematic and unambiguous way to the real world entities they represent. Thus they are intricate ``castles in the air{\{}''{\}}, which may certainly have pathways built to link them together, but lack the solid foundations required for robust real-time dynamic interoperability between structures not mapped to each other in the design stage. Current ontology interoperability strategies lack such a meaning-based arbitrator, and depend instead on human mediation or heuristic approaches. This paper introduces the symbol grounding problem, explains its relevance for the Semantic Web, illustrates how inappropriate correspondence between symbol and referent can result in logically valid but meaningless inferences, examines some of the shortcomings of the current approach in dealing effectively at the level of meaning, and concludes with some ideas for identifying effective grounding strategies.},

abstract = {The Internet is a giant semiotic system. It is a massive collection of Peirce's three kinds of signs: icons, which show the form of something; indices, which point to something; and symbols, which represent something according to some convention. But current proposals for ontologies and metadata have overlooked some of the most important features of signs. A sign has three aspects: it is (1) an entity that represents (2) another entity to (3) an agent. By looking only at the signs themselves, some metadata proposals have lost sight of the entities they represent and the agents — human, animal, or robot — which interpret them. With its three branches of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, semiotics provides guidelines for organizing and using signs to represent something to someone for some purpose. Besides representation, semiotics also supports methods for translating patterns of signs intended for one purpose to other patterns intended for different but related purposes. This article shows how the fundamental semiotic primitives are represented in semantically equivalent notations for logic, including controlled natural languages and various computer languages.},

abstract = {Different stakeholders in the design of an enterprise information system have their own view on that design. To help produce a coherent design this paper presents a framework that aids in specifying relations between such views. To help produce a consistent design the framework also aids in specifying consistency rules that apply to the view relations and in checking the consistency according to those rules. The framework focuses on the higher levels of abstraction in a design, we refer to design at those levels of abstraction as architectural design. The highest level of abstraction that we consider is that of business process design and the lowest level is that of software component design. The contribution of our framework is that it provides a collection of basic concepts that is common to viewpoints in the area of enterprise information systems. These basic concepts aid in relating viewpoints by providing: (i) a common terminology that helps stakeholders to understand each others concepts; and (ii) a basis for defining re-usable consistency rules. In particular we define re-usable rules to check consistency between behavioural views that overlap or are a refinement of each other. We also present an architecture for a tool suite that supports our framework. We show that our framework can be applied, by performing a case study in which we specify the relations and consistency rules between the RM-ODP enterprise, computational and information viewpoints.},

abstract = {Ontology, in its original philosophical sense, is a fundamental branch of metaphysics focusing on the study of existence; its objective is to determine what entities and types of entities actually exist and thus to study the structure of the world. In contrast, in computer science an ontology is an engineering artifact, usually a “conceptual model” of (some aspect of) the world, typically formalised as a logical theory. Formalising an ontology using a suitable logic opens up the possibility of using automated reasoning to support both ontology design and deployment. The value of such support has already been demonstrated in medical applications, where it has been used to help repair and enrich ontologies that play an important role in patient care.Even with the aid of reasoning enabled tools, developing and maintaining good quality ontologies is a difficult and costly task, and problems related to the availability of good quality ontologies threaten to limit the deployment of ontology-based information systems. This has resulted in ontology engineers increasingly looking to the philosophy community for possible solutions, and in particular as a source of relevant expertise in the organisation and formalisation of knowledge.},

abstract = {Ontologies are being applied very successfully in supporting information and knowledge exchange between people and organisations. However, for many reasons, different people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies. Therefore, in order to exchange information and knowledge, either everyone must adopt the same ontology — an unlikely scenario — or it must be possible to reconcile different ontologies. This chapter examines the issues and techniques in the reconciliation of ontologies. First, it examines the reasons why people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies, and why the pervasive adoption of common ontologies is unlikely. It then reviews alternative architectures for multipleontology systems on a large scale. A comparative analysis is provided of a number of frameworks which analyse types of mismatches between ontologies. The process of ontology reconciliation is outlined. Finally, some existing software tools that support reconciliation are surveyed, and areas are identified where further work is necessary.},

Five core concepts and relationships provide the foundation for the approved IEEE1471 version: every system has an architecture, but an architecture is not a system; an architecture and an architecture description are not the same thing; architecture standards, descriptions, and development processes can differ and be developed separately; architecture descriptions are inherently multiviewed; and separating the concept of an object's view from its specification is an effective way to write architecture description standards. IEEE 1471 focuses on both software intensive systems and more general systems, such as information systems, embedded systems, systems-of-systems, product lines, and product families in which software plays a substantial role in development, operation, or evolution},

It is striking to see that, though MDE is supposed to be about precise modelling, MDE core concepts are usually described in natural language or at best, using sketchy "{\`{a}}-la" UML diagrams. These diagrams are very often inconsistent and too vague to reason about. Most of the time, they are neither validated, not even used by their authors. When precise descriptions are provided, it is only to describe a specific technology. But since Model Driven Engineering is a about supporting multiple Technological Spaces (TS), the concepts of model, metamodel, and transformation should be declined, not only in the MDA TS, but also in the Grammarware TS, Documentware TS, Dataware TS, etc. To cope with these prob- lems, we decided to start research on defining a megamodel of MDE. This paper shown how the set theory and language theory could help in understanding MDE concepts and their relationships. The megamodel could also be seen as a first version of a rudimentary theory for reasoning about MDE concepts.},

In our approach, this property can be systematically evaluated by comparing the level of homomorphism between a concrete representation of the worldview underlying the language (captured in a metamodel of the language), with an ex- plicit and formal representation of a conceptualization of that domain (a refer- ence ontology). The framework proposed comprises a number of properties that must be reinforced for an isomorphism to take place between these two entities. In order to illustrate the approach proposed, we evaluate and extend a fragment of the UML static metamodel for the purpose of conceptual modeling, by com- paring it with an excerpt of a philosophically and cognitive well-founded refer- ence ontology.},

To this end, I first characterize the typing disciplines underlying these different schools of thought, then identify their respective trade-offs, subsequently observe what aspects of these rather different typing approaches are compatible with each other and which are inherently incompatible, and finally propose a scheme that supports fluid transitioning between the approaches.

In order for any of these systems to exchange information, the data must be converted from the source schema to the receiver schema. The current approach to the data interoperability problem is to write ad-hoc data interface programs for each pair of communicating systems. Experience shows that development and maintenance of these programs is expensive in terms of both time and money. Worse, the total effort required increases with the square of the number of communicating systems. Finally, these hard-coded interfaces support only the information transfer anticipated during development, and not “pull-on-demand” transfers. It is plainly evident that the current approach cannot be made to support the requirements of the infosphere, or even those of the immediate future. 2.},

abstract = {Enterprises interoperability becomes a necessary and critical task for enterprises as the information and complexity of systems increase exponentially. To adapt existing information systems to new requirements and build bridges between them, a conceptual vision and understanding of interoperability can facilitate the technical development to reduce the conflicts and gaps between heterogeneous systems. Now the focus shifts from the syntactic concern to semantic issues. Semantic heterogeneity currently becomes the next barrier and challenge to face in enterprise interoperability, it promises to play a major role to enable interoperability of enterprise information systems. The approach can be transposed at enterprise decision level, where heterogeneous business processes also need to be interoperable. SOA helps to explore a loosely coupled architecture with many advantages, especially for enhancing interoperability among enterprises. To obtain business process interoperability, service orchestration and choreography could coordinate and compose the services and processes effectively. This paper, first gives a brief introduction of main issues in this domain, and then recalls a framework for enterprise interoperability. Based on these methodologies and the interoperability framework, a new architecture for enterprise interoperability of information systems using SOA ideology and semantic web technologies is proposed, whose final objective is to enable and enhance enterprise interoperability and then create business values.},

Lowe$\backslash$nThe Four-Category Ontology: A Metaphysical Foundation for Natural Science$\backslash$n$\backslash$nE.J. Lowe, The Four-Category Ontology: A Metaphysical Foundation for Natural Science, Oxford University Press, 2006, 240pp, 65.00 (hbk), ISBN 0199254397.$\backslash$nReviewed by Ryan Wasserman, Western Washington University$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn his latest book, E.J. Lowe develops and defends a "four-category" ontology consisting of objects, kinds, attributes, and modes. The book is, appropriately enough, divided into four sections. Part I introduces the key features of the four-category ontology, contrasting it with rival systems. Part II explains the view in more detail, focusing on the distinction between object and property. Part III then uses the resources of the four-category ontology to provide a unified theory of dispositions, laws, and causal powers. Part IV concludes with some reflections on truth, realism, and truthmaking. The book is ambitious in its goals and clear in its presentation. There is significant overlap with previously published material, but those who follow Lowe's work will appreciate having a systematic statement of his current philosophical position. New readers will also find many topics of interest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLowe traces his ontological ancestry back to the Categories and, like Aristotle, he begins with a pair of fundamental distinctions. First, Lowe distinguishes between substantial and non-substantial entities. Second, he distinguishes between particulars and universals. These two distinctions cut across each other, generating four fundamental categories: substantial particulars (objects, like this apple), non-substantial particulars (modes or "tropes", like the redness of this apple), non-substantial universals (attributes, like redness) and substantial universals (kinds, like apple). Objects are directly characterized by modes, which are instances of attributes. Attributes directly characterize kinds which have objects as their instances. All four categories are thus bound together in what Lowe calls "the Ontological Square".$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe four-category ontology may boast an impressive pedigree, but it lacks contemporary support. Lowe conjectures that the view is typically rejected on grounds of parsimony. He counters that the four-category ontology offers superior explanatory power, so that entities are not posited beyond necessity. In particular, Lowe argues that his view provides the best account of (a) laws of nature and (b) the dispositional-categorical distinction. I will discuss these issues in turn.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLowe's account of laws -- previously developed in Kinds of Being (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989) -- is similar to that of David Armstrong, insofar as both take laws to involve universals. For Armstrong, law statements take the form All Fs are Gs. It is a law that all Fs are Gs (as opposed to an accidentally true generalization) when the universals Fness and Gness are linked by a "necessitation" relation. Lowe, in contrast, maintains that laws are more accurately represented as having the form K is F or Ks are F, where K is a kind and F is an attribute (e.g., Benzene is flammable, electrons are negatively charged). Law statements are thus generics, rather than universal generalizations. And laws themselves are grounded in the nature of kinds, rather than the distribution of the necessitation relation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLowe claims three advantages over Armstrong. First, his account more accurately reflects the syntax of ordinary law statements. This may be correct, but Lowe himself admits that syntax is no sure guide to ontology. (p.25)$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSecond, in contrast to Armstrong, Lowe's laws allow for exceptions, this being one of the distinguishing features of generic statements. (p.145) The claim that rubber stretches, for example, is consistent with there being some non-stretchy thing made of rubber. (Contrast this with the universal generalization All rubber things are stretchy). This may be an advantage, but it also raises a difficult question: what makes some laws strict and others not? Armstrong could perhaps augment his account by allowing for a variety of more-or-less stringent necessitation relations (e.g., necessitates to degree .8, necessitates to degree .9). He could then say: when the original necessitation relation links two universals we have a strict law, whereas weaker necessitation relations give us probabilistic laws. The problem for Lowe is that, on his account, all laws have the same sort of "ontological ground": there are only attributes characterizing kinds. There are no necessitation relations to account for the difference between strict and probabilistic laws, so from whence does it come?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFinally, Lowe claims an advantage over Armstrong in that he avoids a "mysterious" second-order relation of necessitation. Of course, Lowe does say that laws involve the "characterization" of kinds by attributes. What exactly is the characterization relation? Well, Lowe tells us that it is not a "genuine" relation at all, but an "internal" relation which is not an "element of being" but which nonetheless gives us a "real connection". (pp.45-7) This will strike some as obscure, but Lowe is quick to point out that Armstrong is already committed to an analogous "non-relational" tie between universals and objects. What he is not so forthcoming about is that, whereas Armstrong speaks of objects "instantiating" universals, Lowe speaks both of objects "instantiating" kinds and of attributes "characterizing" kinds. In other words, Lowe doubles the number of non-relational relations. Add to this the fact that Lowe requires a primitive distinction between substantial and non-substantial universals (i.e., kinds and attributes) and the apparent advantages over Armstrong begin to look doubtful.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWhether or not the proposed theory has any advantages over Armstrong's view, it certainly has some of the disadvantages. In addition to an expansive ontology, Lowe's theory seems vulnerable to a version of the inference problem, which has long plagued Armstrong's own account. The problem for Armstrong is to explain how facts about universals support inferences concerning particulars. Suppose, for example, that Fness necessitates Gness. How does this validate the inference from a is F to a is G? The very same challenge can be posed to Lowe. Suppose that kind K is characterized by Fness. How does this validate the inference from a is K to a is F? To take a specific example: how do we deduce that this material is water-soluble from the premises that this material is sodium-chloride and sodium-chloride is water-soluble? Lowe replies: we don't. (p.29) The inference is not deductively valid, since the law admits of exceptions. Such a reply will not help in the case of strict laws, but let that pass. Even if the inference in question is not deductively valid, it is inductively strong. Why? How do facts about universals tell us anything about particulars? This mysterious link between universals and particulars lies at the heart of the inference problem and on this crucial point Lowe has little more to say than Armstrong.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLet us turn now to the dispositional-categorical distinction. Philosophers typically distinguish between categorical and dispositional properties, where the former concern actual status and the latter concern hypothetical behavior. To ascribe squareness or roundness to an object is to say what it is like in the here and now. To ascribe elasticity or fragility, in contrast, is to point beyond the present to the realm of possibility. Lowe accepts the dispositional-categorical distinction, but locates it at the level of predicates, rather than properties. In fact, Lowe claims that dispositional and categorical ascriptions are just two different ways of attributing the same property. The key to understanding this claim is that, in Lowe's system, there are two "routes" from objects to attributes (understood as universal properties). An object can fall under a kind which is characterized by the attribute. An object can also be characterized by a mode which is an instance of the attribute. Lowe claims that this distinction corresponds to the distinction between dispositional and categorical predication, but I find the details of his account somewhat elusive. Let us focus on his example of the rubber eraser. We can truthfully assert that this piece of rubber stretches or is disposed to stretch. According to Lowe, these dispositional ascriptions are true in virtue of the fact that the eraser falls under the kind rubber, which is characterized by the attribute of stretchiness. And this might be the case, of course, even if the eraser is not currently being stretched. For the eraser to be stretching (as opposed to stretchy), is for it to be characterized by an instance of stretchiness. In other words, the categorical statement requires the existence of a corresponding mode, while the dispositional statement does not. But in both cases we are ultimately attributing the very same property.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIt is this last claim I find particularly puzzling. There is stretchiness -- the property of being stretchable -- and the property of being stretched. I can understand the claim that something has the first property just in case its kind is characterized by that property. I can understand the claim that something has the second property just in case it is characterized by a corresponding instance. What I do not understand is Lowe's identification of the first property with the second. In fact, I think this identification leads to trouble for Lowe. Imagine a world with nothing but a lonely rubber eraser. Suppose it is never stretched. Can we still say that it is stretchable? Not on the current account. For, if it is never stretched, there is no property instance. If there is no property instance, there is no property, since Lowe explicitly rejects uninstantiated univer},

abstract = {Many authors have discussed the importance of ontological concerns in the development of information systems, emphasizing the benefits of ontology-based approaches to conceptual modeling tasks. A principled ontology-driven approach typically relies on the definition of a domain ontology and its use in subsequent phases of information system design and integration. Many of the challenges in the application of such an approach are related to addressing ontological concerns (defining the nature of phenomena of interest) and addressing information modeling concerns (defining the information demand about the phenomena of interest). In this paper we argue that ontological concerns should be clearly separated from information modeling concerns. We have observed that ontology-based approaches and information modeling approaches have been treated mostly in isolation, with the consequence that the relation between a domain ontology and an information model is still in need of clarification, despite the efforts of the formal ontology and information modeling communities. We strive to provide the initial steps for a principled two-level approach in which a domain ontology addressing ontological concerns is used as a starting point for the definition of an information model, according to a certain information demand. We identify some important decisions that should guide the construction of information models.},

abstract = {This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a “modularization” is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched. {\textcopyright} 1972, ACM. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {What is needed to enable communication about observation and measurement results in information systems? Information system ontologies make a certain conceptualization explicit and partially account for the meanings of symbols associated with this conceptualization. Yet, the meaning of signs denoting measurement results such as ``10 m'', ``red'' or ``high'' cannot be specified with currently available ontologies. They fail to separate the ontological nature of some observable quality from the specification of how to observe and name the measurement result. We employ the foundational ontology DOLCE for characterizing the ontological nature of observable magnitudes. This involves dealing with ontological questions like ``What kinds of observable qualities exist, in which entity does the observed quality inhere and how are the magnitudes of the observed quality structured?''. Then, in order to capture the semantic aspects of an observation result, we introduce semantic reference spaces, which help deal with semantic questions like ``Do the signs ``10 m'', ``33 feet'' or ``shallow'' have the same meaning? Do these signs refer to the same entity, e.g. the depth magnitude of a lake? How to establish a unit of measure?''. We posit that the semantic questions can be approached efficiently only if agreement is reached on the ontological questions, and show that the specification of the meaning of signs denoting measurement results is enabled via the extension of the foundational ontology DOLCE with semantic reference spaces.},

abstract = {Current modelling approaches often purport to be based on a strong theoretical underpinning but, in fact, contain many ill-defined concepts or even contradictions leading to potential misinterpretation. Although much modelling in object-oriented contexts is focussed on the use of the Unified Modelling Language (UML), this paper presents a technology-agnostic approach that analyses the basic concepts of structural models and modelling in software engineering, using an approach based on representation theory. We examine the different kinds of interpretive mappings (either isotypical, prototypical or metatypical) that are required in order to trace model entities back to the SUS (subject under study) entities that they represent. The difference between forward- and backward-looking models is also explained, as are issues relating to the appropriate definition of modelling languages in general based on representation theory. The need for product and process integration in methodologies is then addressed, leading to the conclusion that a mesh of verbal plus nominal nodes is necessary in any methodology metamodel. Finally, the need for a common, cross-cutting modelling infrastructure is established, and a solution proposed in the form of an ontologically universal modelling language, OOLang. Examples of the application of these theoretical analyses to the suite of OMG products (particularly SPEM, UML and MOF) are given throughout, with the hope that awareness of the importance of a better modelling infrastructure can be developed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this chapter, we discuss the foundations of an ontological-based architecture for organizing information and knowledge within corporations. Our research focus on three main eforts: (i) to shed some light on the ontological status of corporations, (ii) to understand the relations between corporate units, and (iii) to approach the duties that corporations have to manage. After presenting background theories, we analyze the corporation through two dimensions, namely, a descriptive and a normative. While the former approaches the structure of the corporation from the point of view of its units, the later approaches it from the point of view of duties and obligations. The descriptive side of our investigation is conducted through principles of top-level formal ontologies; the normative side is addressed through the so-called social ontology. The relevance of developing such analysis rests on the need of a beter understanding of corporations, its structures, and its activities. Such insight can provide a formal framework suitable to be applied in information systems, working in the context of modern technologies like the Semantic Web.},

The chapter goes on to specify key criteria for evaluating process modeling approaches, suggesting the different kinds of modeling approaches that seem particularly effective for supporting different uses. A representative set of examples of current process modeling approaches, and different ways in which process modeling is being used to good advantage, is then described. These examples are then used to suggest some key research challenges that need to be met in order for society to obtain a large range of further advantages from the continued development of process and process modeling technology.},

However, current mainstream research on this topic faces serious challenges, which forces us to question established lines of research and to rethink the underlying approaches. We argue that reasoning for the Semantic Web should be understood as ``shared inference,'' which is not necessarily based on deductive methods. Model-theoretic semantics (and sound and complete reasoning based on it) functions as a gold standard, but applications dealing with large-scale and noisy data usually cannot afford the required runtimes. Approximate methods, including deductive ones, but also approaches based on entirely different methods like machine learning or nature-inspired computing need to be investigated, while quality assurance needs to be done in terms of precision and recall values (as in information retrieval) and not necessarily in terms of soundness and completeness of the underlying algorithms.},

While all of them address different visions and needs, they share a common theme: How do we manage massive amounts of heterogeneous data, derive knowledge out of them instead of drowning in information, and how do we make our findings reproducible and reusable by others? In a network of knowledge, topics span across scientific disciplines and the idea of domain ontologies as common agreements seems like an illusion. In this work, we argue that these trends require a radical paradigm shift in ontology engineering away from a small number of authoritative, global ontologies developed top-down, to a high number of local ontologies that are driven by application needs and developed bottom-up out of observation data. Similarly as the early Web was replaced by a social Web in which volunteers produce data instead of purely consuming it, the next generation of knowledge infrastructures has to enable users to become knowledge engineers themselves. Surprisingly, existing ontology engineering frameworks are not well suited for this new perspective. Hence, we propose an observation-driven ontology engineering framework, show how its layers can be realized using specific methodologies, and relate the framework to existing work on geo-ontologies.},

These systems usually consist of different hardware (computers, NC machines, robots and workstations), software (operating systems, programming languages) and application systems (analysis packages, simulators, database management systems, file management systems). The databases of these systems are often different in their logical and physical structures since they are established using different data management facilities and their structures are tailored to support the various design and manufacturing activities. In Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM), these systems need to be interconnected to allow sharing of hardware and software resources and the timely delivery of data to these component systems. This paper describes the architecture of an Integrated Manufacturing Data Administration System (IMDAS) which provides the users and application software with a unified view of the global database that is physically distributed among dissimilar component systems. The IMDAS provides a high-level semantic view of the global database using a semantic association model OSAM* and a high-level language for global data manipulation to enable the user or the application software to access the global database easily and meaningfully. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Internet is a common information space populated with many entities (e.g., Internet of Things) with different information system types. Each of them has its own context of how to build and process documents (e.g., form documents). This leads to heterogeneous documents in terms of syntax and semantics, which are difficult to make information fusion from one context to another. To resolve this problem, this paper uses semantic interoperability technique which consists of two automatic stages including consistent data understanding and reasonable data usage. To implement semantic interoperability, this paper proposes a novel automatic tabular document exchange (DocEx) framework comprised of a new tabular document model (TabDoc) and a semantic inference scheme to fit the two stages above respectively. In this TabDoc model, a new Tabular Document Language (DocLang) as a communication medium between users and devices is provided, which is not only an information representation language but also a rule language for semantic inference as well. Abstract sub-tree-based semantic relations constructing the logical structure of a tabular document are separated from their presentational structures, clarifying the relationship between semantic groups (e.g., a cell or a block) with the help of a common dictionary CONEX. Besides, this paper proposes a semantic inference algorithm (SIA) executing the inference procedure on received tabular documents created by a Table Designer system which integrates with SIA. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to the processing of flight ticket booking in a realistic e-business scenario. The results show that the proposed method in this paper improves the performance of information fusion among different information systems on the Internet.},

@book{Henderson-Sellers2012,
abstract = {"Computing as a discipline is maturing rapidly. However, with maturity often comes a plethora of subdisciplines, which, as time progresses, can become isolationist. The subdisciplines of modelling, metamodelling, ontologies and modelling languages within software engineering e.g. have, to some degree, evolved separately and without any underpinning formalisms. Introducing set theory as a consistent underlying formalism, Brian Henderson-Sellers shows how a coherent framework can be developed that clearly links these four, previously separate, areas of software engineering. In particular, he shows how the incorporation of a foundational ontology can be beneficial in resolving a number of controversial issues in conceptual modelling, especially with regard to the perceived differences between linguistic metamodelling and ontological metamodelling. An explicit consideration of domain-specific modelling languages is also included in his mathematical analysis of models, metamodels, ontologies and modelling languages. This encompassing and detailed presentation of the state-of-the-art in modelling approaches mainly aims at researchers in academia and industry. They will find the principled discussion of the various subdisciplines extremely useful, and they may exploit the unifying approach as a starting point for future research."--Publisher's website. 1Introduction -- Mathematics for Modelling -- Models -- Metamodels -- Ontologies -- Modelling Languages -- Linking Models, Metamodels, Ontologies and Modelling Languages -- Other Related Work and Further Discussion -- Conclusions and Further Work.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem by leveraging the ideas of competency questions and test-before software development. We first analyse real-world competency questions collected from two different domains. Analysis shows that many of them can be categorised into patterns that differ along a set of features. Then we employ the linguistic notion of presupposition to describe the ontology requirements implied by competency questions, and show that these requirements can be tested automatically. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

@book{Gamut1991,
abstract = {Potts (2005, 2007) claims that Grices conventional implicatures offer a powerful argument in favor of a multidimensional semantics, one in which certain expressions fail to interact scopally with various operators because their meaning is located in a separate dimension. Focusing on Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses NRRs), we explore an alternative to Pottss bidimensional account. In our analysis, (1) NRRs can be syntactically attached with matrix scope, despite their appearance in embedded positions; (2) NRRs can in some cases be syntactically attached within the scope of other operators (whether attitudinal or not), in which case they semantically interact with them; (3) NRRs are semantically conjoined with the rest of the sentence, but (4) they are subject to a pragmatic rule that requires that their content be relatively easy to accommodate hence some non-trivial projection facts when NRRs do not have matrix scope. In this paper, we only develop (1) and (2), which pertain to the scopal behavior of NRRs. (1), which is in full agreement with the classic high attachment analysis of NRRs, shows that Pottss semantic machinery is not necessary: its effects follow from more conservative semantic assumptions once an adequate syntax is postulated. Because of (2), Pottss machinery makes incorrect predictions when NRRs have a non-matrix attachment and interact scopally with other operators. Semantic arguments for (2) were given in Wang et al. 2005 and Amaral et al. 2007, but were re-analyzed in pragmatic terms in Harris and Potts 2009a, b; we provide new evidence that suggests that in some cases the latter analysis is implausible.},

@phdthesis{Carraretto2012a,
abstract = {Many authors have discussed the importance of ontological concerns in the development of information systems, emphasizing the benefits of ontology-based approaches to conceptual modeling tasks. A principled ontology-driven approach typically relies on the definition of a domain ontology and its use in subsequent phases of information system design and integration. Many of the challenges in the application of such an approach are related to addressing ontological concerns (defining the nature of phenomena of interest) and addressing informational concerns (defining the information demand about the phenomena of interest). In this thesis, we argue that ontological concerns should be clearly separated from informational concerns. We have observed that ontology-based approaches and information modeling approaches have been treated mostly in isolation, with the consequence that the relation between a domain ontology and an information model is still in need of clarification, despite the efforts of the formal ontology and the information modeling communities. Therefore, in this thesis, we analyze conceptual modeling in terms of two levels, namely, the so-called ontological level and, what we call, the information level. Our initial effort is to characterize the information level in harmony with existing works on information modeling and to align our information level approach with the existing ones concerning the ontological level. Then, we strive to provide a model-driven approach in which a domain ontology addressing ontological concerns (at the ontological level) is used as a starting point for the definition of an information model addressing informational concerns (at the information level). Our model-driven approach is guided by several systematic informational decisions that we identify here, which assist the addressing of an information demand. We adopt a philosophically well-founded profile of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams, called OntoUML, to represent domain ontologies. Further, we adopt UML class diagrams to represent information models in an object-oriented approach. Finally, we provide tool support for the model transformation from OntoUML to UML in order to operationalize the approach and show its technical feasibility.},

abstract = {Poor data quality can seriously hinder or damage the efficiency and effectiveness of organizations and businesses. The growing awareness of such repercussions has led to major public initiatives like the "Data Quality Act" in the USA and the "European 2003/98" directive of the European Parliament. Batini and Scannapieco present a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the wide set of issues related to data quality. They start with a detailed description of different data quality dimensions, like accuracy, completeness, and consistency, and their importance in different types of data, like federated data, web data, or time-dependent data, and in different data categories classified according to frequency of change, like stable, long-term, and frequently changing data. The book's extensive description of techniques and methodologies from core data quality research as well as from related fields like data mining, probability theory, statistical data analysis, and machine learning gives an excellent overview of the current state of the art. The presentation is completed by a short description and critical comparison of tools and practical methodologies, which will help readers to resolve their own quality problems. This book is an ideal combination of the soundness of theoretical foundations and the applicability of practical approaches. It is ideally suited for everyone -- researchers, students, or professionals -- interested in a comprehensive overview of data quality issues. In addition, it will serve as the basis for an introductory course or for self-study on this topic. This is a comprehensive description of the Enterprise Ontology, a collection of terms and definitions relevant to business enterprises. We state its intended purposes, describe how we went about building it, define all the terms and describe our experiences in converting these into formal definitions. We then describe how we used the Enterprise Ontology and give an evaluation which compares the actual uses with original purposes. We conclude by summarising what we have learned. The Enterprise Ontology was developed within the Enterprise Project, a collaborative effort to provide a framework for enterprise modelling. The ontology was built to serve as a basis for this framework which includes methods and a computer tool set for enterprise modelling. We give an overview of the Enterprise Project, elaborate on the intended use of the ontology, and give a brief overview of the process we went through to build it. The scope of the Enterprise Ontology covers those core concepts required for the project, which will appeal to a wider audience. We present natural language definitions for all the terms, starting with the foundational concepts (e.g. entity, relationship, actor). These are used to define the main body of terms, which are divided into the following subject areas: activities, organisation, strategy and marketing. We review some of the things learned during the formalisation process of converting the natural language definitions into Ontolingua. We identify and propose solutions for what may be general problems occurring in the development of a wide range of ontologies in other domains. We then characterise in general terms the sorts of issues that will be faced when converting an informal ontology into a formal one. Finally, we describe our experiences in using the Enterprise Ontology. We compare these with the intended uses, noting our successes and failures. We conclude with an overall evaluation and summary of what we have learned.},

@article{Eriksson2013a,
abstract = {Context: Although metamodelling is generally accepted as important for our understanding of software and systems development, arguments about the validity and utility of ontological versus linguistic metamodelling continue. Objective: The paper examines the traditional, metamodel-focused construction of modelling languages in the context of language use, and particularly speech act theory. These concepts are then applied to the problems introduced by the ''Orthogonal Classification Architecture'' that is often called the ontological/linguistic paradox. The aim of the paper is to show how it is possible to overcome these problems. Method: The paper adopts a conceptual-Analytical approach by revisiting the published arguments and developing an alternative metamodelling architecture based on language use. Results: The analysis shows that when we apply a language use perspective of meaning to traditional modelling concepts, a number of incongruities and misconceptions in the traditional approaches are revealed -issues that are not evident in previous work based primarily on set theory. Clearly differentiating between the extensional and intensional aspects of class concepts (as sets) and also between objects (in the social world) and things (in the physical world) allows for a deeper understanding to be gained of the relationship between the ontological and linguistic views promulgated in the modelling world. Conclusions: We propose that a viewpoint that integrates language use ideas into traditional modelling (and metamodelling) is vital, and stress that meaning is not inherent in the physical world; meaning, and thus socially valid objects, are constructed by use of language, which may or may not establish a one-to-one correspondence relationship between objects and physical things. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Clinical pathway is an approach to standardise care processes to support the implementations of clinical guidelines and protocols. It is designed to support the management of treatment processes including clinical and non-clinical activities, resources and also financial aspects. It provides detailed guidance for each stage in the management of a patient with the aim of improving the continuity and coordination of care across different disciplines and sectors. However, in the practical treatment process, the lack of knowledge sharing and information accuracy of paper-based clinical pathways burden health-care staff with a large amount of paper work. This will often result in medical errors, inefficient treatment process and thus poor quality medical services. This paper first presents a theoretical underpinning and a co-design research methodology for integrated pathway management by drawing input from organisational semiotics. An approach to integrated clinical pathway management is then proposed, which aims to embed pathway knowledge into treatment processes and existing hospital information systems. The capability of this approach has been demonstrated through the case study in one of the largest hospitals in China. The outcome reveals that medical quality can be improved significantly by the classified clinical pathway knowledge and seamless integration with hospital information systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract = {The need for managing distributed systems is prominent in e-government.
Different applications and platforms that cover the overall range of the
e-government implementation area need to interoperate in order to
provide integrated governmental services to the citizens. This paper
proposes an ontologically principled service-oriented architecture for
the administration and integration of distributed nodes in an
e-government network. The goal of the proposed design is to improve
effectiveness and coherence by taking advantage of the enabling
technologies of service-oriented computing, web services and ontologies.
A two-level semantic mediator model is proposed to both provide an
integrated description of entities and map actual information to them.
This architecture was used on a prototype system developed for managing
distributed educational directorates in the prefecture of Achaia,
Greece. The pilot use of the system led to efficient decision making
since it managed to mine information that was previously `buried' in the
local governmental infrastructure nodes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

In simple terms, ontological adequacy is a measure of how close the models produced using a modeling language are to the situations in reality they are supposed to represent. In this thesis, we show how modeling languages can be evaluated and (re)designed with the purpose of improving their ontological adequacy, by proposing a systematic evaluation method for comparing a metamodel of the concepts underlying a language to a reference ontology of the corresponding domain in reality.},

Much about language continues to be only hazily understood, distorted by our habitual attitude--often one of indifference--toward words, or by lingering assumptions based on discredited theories. What IS the relationship between words and what the words refer to? Between words and the way we think? Can understanding such matters lead to greater precision in communication? Readers considering these questions find themselves at the crossroads of linguistics and communications theory, of literary criticism and philosophy--an interdisciplinary nexus claimed by the increasingly influential field of semiotics--and "The Meaning of Meaning" will prove, as it has over the last six decades, an essential resource.},

We present examples of such transformations, but we also present a set Of example correspondences illustrating the needs for particular representation constructs, such as aggregates, value-generating built-in functions and paths, which are missing from SPARQL.

Even though these notions have been in widespread use for quite a while, there is still little consensus about when exactly it is appropriate to use them. The aim of this article is to start establishing a consensus about generally acceptable terminology. Its main contributions are the distinction between two fundamentally different kinds of model roles, i.e. token model versus type model (The terms type and token have been introduced by C.S. Peirce, 18391914.), a formal notion of metaness, and the consideration of generalization as yet another basic relationship between models. In particular, the recognition of the fundamental difference between the above mentioned two kinds of model roles is crucial in order to enable communication among the model driven engineering community that is free of both unnoticed misunderstandings and unnecessary disagreement.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the concept of information. It follows different approaches for defining information before discussing a knowledge-in-action view on information as part of sociomaterial practices. Drawing from Stamper's (1991) extended semiological framework the paper proposes its reinterpretation to study information as a sociomaterial phenomenon. The paper further argues that rather than focusing on finding general definitions for information, intellectual efforts should concentrate on characteristics and attributes of information. Combining earlier efforts in this direction different attributes of information such as novelty, time dependence, or goal relevance. are introduced. Locating those attributes within Stamper's extended semiological framework helps to identify different aspects of sociomaterial context affecting information. Understanding and paying attention to information through its attributes can, therefore, provide guidance for researching information and possibly help advancing the development of information systems.},

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) not only leads the world in space exploration and space science, but, dating back to the early space flights in the 1960s, it has led the world in the use of computers to control complex systems. While others were struggling to automate relatively simple business applications, NASA was stretching the technological envelope to build real-time computer systems to control complicated spacecraft and their support systems in programs such as Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle. Just as the Shuttle stretched the limits of the technology of its time, current projects such as Space Station Freedom and the Earth Observing System stretch the limits of technology today. In order to successfully build these future space systems, NASA needs not only to be at the technological forefront but to go beyond the state of the art and lead the world in software engineering. After the Challenger accident, the Rogers Commission Report made many recommendations for change at NASA and suggested that, after a reasonable time, a National Research Council (N-RC) Committee be formed to evaluate the progress that had been made toward implementation of those recommendations. This latter committee was formed in 1988 and recommended that NASA adopt Independent Verification and Validation (IV{\&}V) of the Shuttle software. The NRC's recommendation was later echoed by other reports and NASA ultimately instituted a fairly robust IV{\&}V effort. Over time, that effort was reduced due to resource constraints and because of the belief that the maturity of the software reduced the need for such a robust oversight activity. Our committee was formed at the beginning of 1992, at the request of NASA, to reevaluate the need for IV{\&}V and to investigate other aspects of NASA's software development and oversight processes. It is, of course, easy to be critical; we want to stress that we found the software and software development procedures for the Space Shuttle to be, in the main, excellent. However, the requirements of space science, applications, and exploration demand that the software be as good as possible. This report describes some ways in which we feel NASA can improve its software oversight activities to continue the successful operation of the Space Shuttle for as long it continues to be a part of the nation's space launch infrastructure. Our committee met over a period of 12 months, conducting interviews, listening to presentations, submitting questions for NASA and its contractors to answer, and reading copious amounts of material. I would personally like to thank the members of the Committee for their hard work.},

abstract = {With increasing size and complexity of the implementa-tions of information systems, it is necessary to use some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the integration of all of the components of the system. This paper defines information systems architecture by creating a d e scriptive framework from disciplines quite independent of information systems, then by analogy specifies in-formation systems architecture based upon the neu-tral, objective framework. Also, some preliminary conclusions about the implications of the resultant descriptive framework are drawn. The discussion is limited to architecture and does not include a strategic planning methodology. T he subject of information systems architecture is beginning to receive considerable attention. The increased scope of design and levels of complex-ity of information systems implementations are forc-ing the use of some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the integration of all of the components of the system. Thirty years ago this issue was not at all significant because the technology itself did not provide for either breadth in scope or depth in complexity in information systems. The inherent limitations of the then-available 4K machines, for example, con-strained design and necessitated suboptimal ap-proaches for automating a business. Current technology is rapidly removing both concep-tual and financial constraints. It is not hard to spec-ulate about, if not realize, very large, very complex systems implementations, extending in scope and complexity to encompass an entire enterprise. One can readily delineate the merits of the large, complex, enterprise-oriented approaches. Such systems allow flexibility in managing business changes and coher-ency in the management of business resources. How-ever, there also is merit in the more traditional, smaller, suboptimal systems design approach. Such systems are relatively economical, quickly imple-mented, and easier to design and manage. In either case, since the technology permits " distrib-uting " large amounts of computing facilities in small packages to remote locations, some kind of structure (or architecture) is imperative because decentraliza-tion without structure is chaos. Therefore, to keep the business from disintegrating, the concept of in-formation systems architecture is becoming less an option and more a necessity for establishing some order and control in the investment of information systems resources. The cost involved and the success of the business depending increasingly on its infor-mation systems require a disciplined approach to the management of those systems.},

@phdthesis{Scheider:2012tj,
abstract = {In this thesis, I propose a method of constructing semantic reference systems for geographic information based on reproducible observations. Similar to spatial reference systems, semantic reference systems consist of formal theories ( refer- ence theories ) with conventionally established interpretations into perceptual and constructive operations (such as pointing to a physical monument, and describing locations relative to it). They can be used to annotate data and describe and compare their semantics. The thesis addresses the grounding part of reference syste ms. I argue that persisting problems of information ontologies, namely the grounding problem and the problem of reference , could be solved using certain principles of construction and imitation in terms of perceptual operations. These operations focus joint human attention on pre-conceptual cognit ive mechanisms, i.e. 'Gestalts', in the perceived space around the body. They also allow an observer to relate foci of attention based on the Gestalt. The memorized relations are expressed by observation predicates, to be established by convention in terms of speech acts of an observation language. These speech acts can be shared, and thus represent lowest level information items. I propo se a kind of “practical constructivism” guided by a formal language. The idea is to describe data categories in terms of observation predicates, i.e. “bottom-up” , in order to reconstruct the underlying observation procedure, instead of presuming abstract concepts. For example, bodies, surfaces, and different kinds of media in the human environment are grounded in terms of pe rceived affordances. Object properties such as waterdepth are grounded in exper iential geometry, visual surfaces and media of diving. I propose a correspo nding reference theory and put it to a practical test in this thesis: I define an essential road network category, namely a junction, and test the definition in Open Street Map.},

Unlike data models, the fundamental asset of ontologies is their relative independence of particular applications, i.e. an ontology consists of relatively generic knowledge that can be reused by different kinds of applications/tasks. The first part of this paper concerns some aspects that help to understand the differences and similarities between ontologies and data models. In the second part we present an ontology engineering framework that supports and favours the genericity of an ontology. We introduce the DOGMA ontology engineering approach that separates "atomic" conceptual relations from "predicative" domain rules. A DOGMA ontology consists of an ontology base that holds sets of intuitive context-specific conceptual relations and a layer of "relatively generic" ontological commitments that hold the domain rules. This constitutes what we shall call the double articulation of a DOGMA ontology.},

abstract = {The Organisations may use heterogeneous ontologies for the same domain which results in the representation of different concepts to the same concept. The interoperability problem arises when two ontologies are trying to commune with each other and hence the ontology mapping is required. The ontology mapping discovers the relationship between the pair of concepts of heterogeneous ontology and depicts whether the concepts are similar or not. The mapping document will be generated on mapping two ontologies. The ontologies must respond to the change requirements which make the mapping document to be inconsistent. This paper reports various mapping tools for mapping two ontologies and depicts various techniques such as mapping composition, mapping adaptation and floating model. It also describes various mapping approaches such as KOAN approach, WISE approach and SKIS approach for making the mapping document to be consistent. The existing mapping techniques and approaches deals with the mapping document consistency. The requirement for reconciliation mapping approach is proposed which uses various scenarios for consistency maintenance. In addition to consistency maintenance, it also provides time efficiency, space efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {Most information systems today are built using “single-level” methodologies, in which both informational and knowledge concepts are built into one level of object and data models. In domains characterised by complexity, large numbers of concepts, and/or a high rate of definitional change, systems based on such models are expensive to maintain and usually have to be replaced after a few years. However, a two-level methodology is possible, in which systems are built from information models only, and driven at runtime by knowledge-level concept definitions, or “archetypes”. In this approach, systems can be built more quickly and last longer, whilst archetypes are authored directly by domain specialists, rather than IT personnel. Executed properly, the approach has the potential for creating future-proof systems and information. Work in the medical informatics domain on electronic health records (EHRs) has shown that a two-level methodology is implementable, makes for smaller systems, and empowers domain users.},

Having identified some in- adequacies, we provide a comprehensive framework to deal with all sorts of coupling. This framework takes into account the distinction be- tween object level - and class level coupling. This distinc- tion refers to dynamic dependencies between objects on one hand and static dependencies between implementa- tions on the other hand, representing important aspects of software quality at run-time and during the maintenance phase, respectively. As far as cohesion is concerned, we analyze a well known metric put forward by Chidamber and Kemerer and re-stated by Li and Henry. As a result, we present a graph theoretic improved version of this metric.},

GFO is a foundational ontology integrating objects and processes. It is being developed by the research group Onto-Med (Ontologies in Medicine) at the University of Leipzig. Unique selling properties of GFO are the following: it includes categories of objects (3D objects) as well as of processes (4D entities) and both are integrated into one coherent framework. GFO presents a multi-categorial approach by admitting universals, concepts, and symbol structures and their interrelations. GFO adopts categories pertaining to levels of reality, and it is designed to support interoperability by principles of ontological mapping and reduction. GFO contains several novel ontological modules, in particular, a module for functions and a module for roles. GFO is designed for applications, firstly in medical, biological, and biomedical areas, but also in the fields of economics and sociology.},

abstract = {The application of Semantic Web technologies to service-oriented architectures (SOA) has promised to mitigate the problem of achieving semantic interoperability as the formal definition of semantics paves the way for higher automation in the mediation process between heterogeneous services. Recently, many ontology-based approaches for semantic interoperability have been developed. However, it remains difficult to compare the various approaches because only domain-specific conceptual frameworks for semantic interoperability exist. Moreover, in SOA practice ontology-based approaches are not widely adopted but still XML-based solutions are dominant. This paper targets to fill this gap and presents ongoing work towards a general conceptual framework for semantic interoperability in SOA as a foundation for comparative reflection. Based on the framework selected approaches both academic and industry-driven are compared. Furthermore, an inherent trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness in achieving semantic interoperability is identified and a potential alleviation based on semantic mediation on domain level is outlined. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {The importance of capabilities and resources for portfolio management and business strategy has been recognized in the management literature. Despite that, little attention has been given to integrate the notions of capabilities and resources in enterprise architecture descriptions. One notable exception is a recent proposal to extend the ArchiMate framework and language to include capability and resources and thus improve ArchiMate's coverage of portfolio management. This paper presents an ontological analysis of the concepts introduced in that proposal, focusing in particular on the resource, capability and competence concepts. We provide an account for these concepts in terms of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). The analysis allows us to identify semantic issues in the proposal and suggests well-founded recommendations for improvements. We revise the proposed metamodel in order to address the identified problems, thereby improving the semantic clarity and usefulness of the proposed language extension. Two real-world cases are modeled with the resulting metamodel to show the applicability of the constructs and relations in an industrial setting.},
