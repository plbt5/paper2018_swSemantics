abstract = {A true semantic web of data requires dynairtic, real-time interoperability between disparate data sources, developed by different organizations in different ways, each for their own specific purposes. Ontology languages provide a means to relate data items to each other in logically well-defined ways, producing complex logical structures with an underlying formal semantics. Whilst these structures have a logical formal semantics, they lack a pragmatic semantics linking them in a systematic and unambiguous way to the real world entities they represent. Thus they are intricate ``castles in the air{\{}''{\}}, which may certainly have pathways built to link them together, but lack the solid foundations required for robust real-time dynamic interoperability between structures not mapped to each other in the design stage. Current ontology interoperability strategies lack such a meaning-based arbitrator, and depend instead on human mediation or heuristic approaches. This paper introduces the symbol grounding problem, explains its relevance for the Semantic Web, illustrates how inappropriate correspondence between symbol and referent can result in logically valid but meaningless inferences, examines some of the shortcomings of the current approach in dealing effectively at the level of meaning, and concludes with some ideas for identifying effective grounding strategies.},

@phdthesis{Scheider:2012tj,
abstract = {In this thesis, I propose a method of constructing semantic reference systems for geographic information based on reproducible observations. Similar to spatial reference systems, semantic reference systems consist of formal theories ( refer- ence theories ) with conventionally established interpretations into perceptual and constructive operations (such as pointing to a physical monument, and describing locations relative to it). They can be used to annotate data and describe and compare their semantics. The thesis addresses the grounding part of reference syste ms. I argue that persisting problems of information ontologies, namely the grounding problem and the problem of reference , could be solved using certain principles of construction and imitation in terms of perceptual operations. These operations focus joint human attention on pre-conceptual cognit ive mechanisms, i.e. 'Gestalts', in the perceived space around the body. They also allow an observer to relate foci of attention based on the Gestalt. The memorized relations are expressed by observation predicates, to be established by convention in terms of speech acts of an observation language. These speech acts can be shared, and thus represent lowest level information items. I propo se a kind of “practical constructivism” guided by a formal language. The idea is to describe data categories in terms of observation predicates, i.e. “bottom-up” , in order to reconstruct the underlying observation procedure, instead of presuming abstract concepts. For example, bodies, surfaces, and different kinds of media in the human environment are grounded in terms of pe rceived affordances. Object properties such as waterdepth are grounded in exper iential geometry, visual surfaces and media of diving. I propose a correspo nding reference theory and put it to a practical test in this thesis: I define an essential road network category, namely a junction, and test the definition in Open Street Map.},

abstract = {In November 2000, the OMG (Object Management Group) made public the MDA™ (Model Driven Architecture) initiative, a particular variant of a new global trend called model engineering. The basic ideas of model engineering are germane to many other approaches such as generative programming, domain specific languages, model-integrated computing, software factories, etc. MDA may be defined as the realization of model engineering principles around a set of OMG standards like MOF (Meta Object Facility), XMI (XML Metadata Interchange), OCL (Object Constraint Language), UML (Unified Modeling Language), CWM (Common Warehouse Metamodel), SPEM (Software Process Engineering Metamodel), etc. Similarly to the basic principle “Everything is an object” that was important in the 80's to set up the object-oriented technology, we suggest here, in model engineering, that the basic principle “Everything is a model” may be key to identifying the essential characteristics of this new trend.},

We present here a formal definition of ontological commitment which aims to capture the very basic ontological assumptions about the intended domain, related to issues such as identity and internal structure. To tackle such issues, a modal framework endowed with mereo-topological primitives has been adopted.

@article{Gonzalez-Perez2007,
abstract = {Current modelling approaches often purport to be based on a strong theoretical underpinning but, in fact, contain many ill-defined concepts or even contradictions leading to potential misinterpretation. Although much modelling in object-oriented contexts is focussed on the use of the Unified Modelling Language (UML), this paper presents a technology-agnostic approach that analyses the basic concepts of structural models and modelling in software engineering, using an approach based on representation theory. We examine the different kinds of interpretive mappings (either isotypical, prototypical or metatypical) that are required in order to trace model entities back to the SUS (subject under study) entities that they represent. The difference between forward- and backward-looking models is also explained, as are issues relating to the appropriate definition of modelling languages in general based on representation theory. The need for product and process integration in methodologies is then addressed, leading to the conclusion that a mesh of verbal plus nominal nodes is necessary in any methodology metamodel. Finally, the need for a common, cross-cutting modelling infrastructure is established, and a solution proposed in the form of an ontologically universal modelling language, OOLang. Examples of the application of these theoretical analyses to the suite of OMG products (particularly SPEM, UML and MOF) are given throughout, with the hope that awareness of the importance of a better modelling infrastructure can be developed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@book{Gamut1991,
abstract = {Potts (2005, 2007) claims that Grices conventional implicatures offer a powerful argument in favor of a multidimensional semantics, one in which certain expressions fail to interact scopally with various operators because their meaning is located in a separate dimension. Focusing on Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses NRRs), we explore an alternative to Pottss bidimensional account. In our analysis, (1) NRRs can be syntactically attached with matrix scope, despite their appearance in embedded positions; (2) NRRs can in some cases be syntactically attached within the scope of other operators (whether attitudinal or not), in which case they semantically interact with them; (3) NRRs are semantically conjoined with the rest of the sentence, but (4) they are subject to a pragmatic rule that requires that their content be relatively easy to accommodate hence some non-trivial projection facts when NRRs do not have matrix scope. In this paper, we only develop (1) and (2), which pertain to the scopal behavior of NRRs. (1), which is in full agreement with the classic high attachment analysis of NRRs, shows that Pottss semantic machinery is not necessary: its effects follow from more conservative semantic assumptions once an adequate syntax is postulated. Because of (2), Pottss machinery makes incorrect predictions when NRRs have a non-matrix attachment and interact scopally with other operators. Semantic arguments for (2) were given in Wang et al. 2005 and Amaral et al. 2007, but were re-analyzed in pragmatic terms in Harris and Potts 2009a, b; we provide new evidence that suggests that in some cases the latter analysis is implausible.},

Despite that, little attention has been given to integrate the notions of capabilities and resources in enterprise architecture descriptions. One notable exception is a recent proposal to extend the ArchiMate framework and language to include capability and resources and thus improve ArchiMate's coverage of portfolio management. This paper presents an ontological analysis of the concepts introduced in that proposal, focusing in particular on the resource, capability and competence concepts. We provide an account for these concepts in terms of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). The analysis allows us to identify semantic issues in the proposal and suggests well-founded recommendations for improvements. We revise the proposed metamodel in order to address the identified problems, thereby improving the semantic clarity and usefulness of the proposed language extension. Two real-world cases are modeled with the resulting metamodel to show the applicability of the constructs and relations in an industrial setting.},

abstract = {Ontologies in current computer science parlance are computer based resources that represent agreed domain semantics. Unlike data models, the fundamental asset of ontologies is their relative independence of particular applications, i.e. an ontology consists of relatively generic knowledge that can be reused by different kinds of applications/tasks. The first part of this paper concerns some aspects that help to understand the differences and similarities between ontologies and data models. In the second part we present an ontology engineering framework that supports and favours the genericity of an ontology. We introduce the DOGMA ontology engineering approach that separates "atomic" conceptual relations from "predicative" domain rules. A DOGMA ontology consists of an ontology base that holds sets of intuitive context-specific conceptual relations and a layer of "relatively generic" ontological commitments that hold the domain rules. This constitutes what we shall call the double articulation of a DOGMA ontology.},

abstract = {The Organisations may use heterogeneous ontologies for the same domain which results in the representation of different concepts to the same concept. The interoperability problem arises when two ontologies are trying to commune with each other and hence the ontology mapping is required. The ontology mapping discovers the relationship between the pair of concepts of heterogeneous ontology and depicts whether the concepts are similar or not. The mapping document will be generated on mapping two ontologies. The ontologies must respond to the change requirements which make the mapping document to be inconsistent. This paper reports various mapping tools for mapping two ontologies and depicts various techniques such as mapping composition, mapping adaptation and floating model. It also describes various mapping approaches such as KOAN approach, WISE approach and SKIS approach for making the mapping document to be consistent. The existing mapping techniques and approaches deals with the mapping document consistency. The requirement for reconciliation mapping approach is proposed which uses various scenarios for consistency maintenance. In addition to consistency maintenance, it also provides time efficiency, space efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {Ontologies are being applied very successfully in supporting information and knowledge exchange between people and organisations. However, for many reasons, different people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies. Therefore, in order to exchange information and knowledge, either everyone must adopt the same ontology — an unlikely scenario — or it must be possible to reconcile different ontologies. This chapter examines the issues and techniques in the reconciliation of ontologies. First, it examines the reasons why people and organisations will tend to use different ontologies, and why the pervasive adoption of common ontologies is unlikely. It then reviews alternative architectures for multipleontology systems on a large scale. A comparative analysis is provided of a number of frameworks which analyse types of mismatches between ontologies. The process of ontology reconciliation is outlined. Finally, some existing software tools that support reconciliation are surveyed, and areas are identified where further work is necessary.},

@article{Sowa:2000di,
abstract = {The Internet is a giant semiotic system. It is a massive collection of Peirce's three kinds of signs: icons, which show the form of something; indices, which point to something; and symbols, which represent something according to some convention. But current proposals for ontologies and metadata have overlooked some of the most important features of signs. A sign has three aspects: it is (1) an entity that represents (2) another entity to (3) an agent. By looking only at the signs themselves, some metadata proposals have lost sight of the entities they represent and the agents — human, animal, or robot — which interpret them. With its three branches of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, semiotics provides guidelines for organizing and using signs to represent something to someone for some purpose. Besides representation, semiotics also supports methods for translating patterns of signs intended for one purpose to other patterns intended for different but related purposes. This article shows how the fundamental semiotic primitives are represented in semantically equivalent notations for logic, including controlled natural languages and various computer languages.},

Lowe$\backslash$nThe Four-Category Ontology: A Metaphysical Foundation for Natural Science$\backslash$n$\backslash$nE.J. Lowe, The Four-Category Ontology: A Metaphysical Foundation for Natural Science, Oxford University Press, 2006, 240pp, 65.00 (hbk), ISBN 0199254397.$\backslash$nReviewed by Ryan Wasserman, Western Washington University$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn his latest book, E.J. Lowe develops and defends a "four-category" ontology consisting of objects, kinds, attributes, and modes. The book is, appropriately enough, divided into four sections. Part I introduces the key features of the four-category ontology, contrasting it with rival systems. Part II explains the view in more detail, focusing on the distinction between object and property. Part III then uses the resources of the four-category ontology to provide a unified theory of dispositions, laws, and causal powers. Part IV concludes with some reflections on truth, realism, and truthmaking. The book is ambitious in its goals and clear in its presentation. There is significant overlap with previously published material, but those who follow Lowe's work will appreciate having a systematic statement of his current philosophical position. New readers will also find many topics of interest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLowe traces his ontological ancestry back to the Categories and, like Aristotle, he begins with a pair of fundamental distinctions. First, Lowe distinguishes between substantial and non-substantial entities. Second, he distinguishes between particulars and universals. These two distinctions cut across each other, generating four fundamental categories: substantial particulars (objects, like this apple), non-substantial particulars (modes or "tropes", like the redness of this apple), non-substantial universals (attributes, like redness) and substantial universals (kinds, like apple). Objects are directly characterized by modes, which are instances of attributes. Attributes directly characterize kinds which have objects as their instances. All four categories are thus bound together in what Lowe calls "the Ontological Square".$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe four-category ontology may boast an impressive pedigree, but it lacks contemporary support. Lowe conjectures that the view is typically rejected on grounds of parsimony. He counters that the four-category ontology offers superior explanatory power, so that entities are not posited beyond necessity. In particular, Lowe argues that his view provides the best account of (a) laws of nature and (b) the dispositional-categorical distinction. I will discuss these issues in turn.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLowe's account of laws -- previously developed in Kinds of Being (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989) -- is similar to that of David Armstrong, insofar as both take laws to involve universals. For Armstrong, law statements take the form All Fs are Gs. It is a law that all Fs are Gs (as opposed to an accidentally true generalization) when the universals Fness and Gness are linked by a "necessitation" relation. Lowe, in contrast, maintains that laws are more accurately represented as having the form K is F or Ks are F, where K is a kind and F is an attribute (e.g., Benzene is flammable, electrons are negatively charged). Law statements are thus generics, rather than universal generalizations. And laws themselves are grounded in the nature of kinds, rather than the distribution of the necessitation relation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLowe claims three advantages over Armstrong. First, his account more accurately reflects the syntax of ordinary law statements. This may be correct, but Lowe himself admits that syntax is no sure guide to ontology. (p.25)$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSecond, in contrast to Armstrong, Lowe's laws allow for exceptions, this being one of the distinguishing features of generic statements. (p.145) The claim that rubber stretches, for example, is consistent with there being some non-stretchy thing made of rubber. (Contrast this with the universal generalization All rubber things are stretchy). This may be an advantage, but it also raises a difficult question: what makes some laws strict and others not? Armstrong could perhaps augment his account by allowing for a variety of more-or-less stringent necessitation relations (e.g., necessitates to degree .8, necessitates to degree .9). He could then say: when the original necessitation relation links two universals we have a strict law, whereas weaker necessitation relations give us probabilistic laws. The problem for Lowe is that, on his account, all laws have the same sort of "ontological ground": there are only attributes characterizing kinds. There are no necessitation relations to account for the difference between strict and probabilistic laws, so from whence does it come?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFinally, Lowe claims an advantage over Armstrong in that he avoids a "mysterious" second-order relation of necessitation. Of course, Lowe does say that laws involve the "characterization" of kinds by attributes. What exactly is the characterization relation? Well, Lowe tells us that it is not a "genuine" relation at all, but an "internal" relation which is not an "element of being" but which nonetheless gives us a "real connection". (pp.45-7) This will strike some as obscure, but Lowe is quick to point out that Armstrong is already committed to an analogous "non-relational" tie between universals and objects. What he is not so forthcoming about is that, whereas Armstrong speaks of objects "instantiating" universals, Lowe speaks both of objects "instantiating" kinds and of attributes "characterizing" kinds. In other words, Lowe doubles the number of non-relational relations. Add to this the fact that Lowe requires a primitive distinction between substantial and non-substantial universals (i.e., kinds and attributes) and the apparent advantages over Armstrong begin to look doubtful.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWhether or not the proposed theory has any advantages over Armstrong's view, it certainly has some of the disadvantages. In addition to an expansive ontology, Lowe's theory seems vulnerable to a version of the inference problem, which has long plagued Armstrong's own account. The problem for Armstrong is to explain how facts about universals support inferences concerning particulars. Suppose, for example, that Fness necessitates Gness. How does this validate the inference from a is F to a is G? The very same challenge can be posed to Lowe. Suppose that kind K is characterized by Fness. How does this validate the inference from a is K to a is F? To take a specific example: how do we deduce that this material is water-soluble from the premises that this material is sodium-chloride and sodium-chloride is water-soluble? Lowe replies: we don't. (p.29) The inference is not deductively valid, since the law admits of exceptions. Such a reply will not help in the case of strict laws, but let that pass. Even if the inference in question is not deductively valid, it is inductively strong. Why? How do facts about universals tell us anything about particulars? This mysterious link between universals and particulars lies at the heart of the inference problem and on this crucial point Lowe has little more to say than Armstrong.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLet us turn now to the dispositional-categorical distinction. Philosophers typically distinguish between categorical and dispositional properties, where the former concern actual status and the latter concern hypothetical behavior. To ascribe squareness or roundness to an object is to say what it is like in the here and now. To ascribe elasticity or fragility, in contrast, is to point beyond the present to the realm of possibility. Lowe accepts the dispositional-categorical distinction, but locates it at the level of predicates, rather than properties. In fact, Lowe claims that dispositional and categorical ascriptions are just two different ways of attributing the same property. The key to understanding this claim is that, in Lowe's system, there are two "routes" from objects to attributes (understood as universal properties). An object can fall under a kind which is characterized by the attribute. An object can also be characterized by a mode which is an instance of the attribute. Lowe claims that this distinction corresponds to the distinction between dispositional and categorical predication, but I find the details of his account somewhat elusive. Let us focus on his example of the rubber eraser. We can truthfully assert that this piece of rubber stretches or is disposed to stretch. According to Lowe, these dispositional ascriptions are true in virtue of the fact that the eraser falls under the kind rubber, which is characterized by the attribute of stretchiness. And this might be the case, of course, even if the eraser is not currently being stretched. For the eraser to be stretching (as opposed to stretchy), is for it to be characterized by an instance of stretchiness. In other words, the categorical statement requires the existence of a corresponding mode, while the dispositional statement does not. But in both cases we are ultimately attributing the very same property.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIt is this last claim I find particularly puzzling. There is stretchiness -- the property of being stretchable -- and the property of being stretched. I can understand the claim that something has the first property just in case its kind is characterized by that property. I can understand the claim that something has the second property just in case it is characterized by a corresponding instance. What I do not understand is Lowe's identification of the first property with the second. In fact, I think this identification leads to trouble for Lowe. Imagine a world with nothing but a lonely rubber eraser. Suppose it is never stretched. Can we still say that it is stretchable? Not on the current account. For, if it is never stretched, there is no property instance. If there is no property instance, there is no property, since Lowe explicitly rejects uninstantiated univer},

abstract = {Graph rewriting (also called reduction) as defined in Wadsworth [t971] was introduced in order to be able to give a more efficient implementation of functional programming languages in the form of lambda calculus or term rewrite systems: identical subterms are shared using pointers. Several other authors, e.g. Ehrig [1979], Staples [1980a, b,c], Raoult [1984] and van den Broek et al. [1986] have given mathematical descriptions of graph rewriting, usually employing concepts from category theory. These papers prove among other things the correctness of graph rewriting in the form of the Church-Rosser property for "well-behaved" (i.e. regular) rewrite systems. However, only Staples has formally studied the soundness and completeness of graph rewriting with respect to term rewriting. In this paper we give a direct operational description of graph rewriting that avoids the category theoretic notions. We show that if a term t is interpreted as a graph g(t) and is reduced in the graph world, then the result represents an actual reduct of the original term t (soundness). For weakly regular term rewrite systems, there is also a completeness result: every normal form of a term t can be obtained from the graphical implementation. We also show completeness for all term rewrite systems which possess a so called hypernormalising strategy, and in that case the strategy also gives a normalising strategy for the graphical implementation. Besides having nice theoretical properties, weakly regular systems offer opportunities for parallelism, since redexes at different places can be executed independently or in parallel, without affecting the final result.},

abstract = {With increasing size and complexity of the implementa-tions of information systems, it is necessary to use some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the integration of all of the components of the system. This paper defines information systems architecture by creating a d e scriptive framework from disciplines quite independent of information systems, then by analogy specifies in-formation systems architecture based upon the neu-tral, objective framework. Also, some preliminary conclusions about the implications of the resultant descriptive framework are drawn. The discussion is limited to architecture and does not include a strategic planning methodology. T he subject of information systems architecture is beginning to receive considerable attention. The increased scope of design and levels of complex-ity of information systems implementations are forc-ing the use of some logical construct (or architecture) for defining and controlling the interfaces and the integration of all of the components of the system. Thirty years ago this issue was not at all significant because the technology itself did not provide for either breadth in scope or depth in complexity in information systems. The inherent limitations of the then-available 4K machines, for example, con-strained design and necessitated suboptimal ap-proaches for automating a business. Current technology is rapidly removing both concep-tual and financial constraints. It is not hard to spec-ulate about, if not realize, very large, very complex systems implementations, extending in scope and complexity to encompass an entire enterprise. One can readily delineate the merits of the large, complex, enterprise-oriented approaches. Such systems allow flexibility in managing business changes and coher-ency in the management of business resources. How-ever, there also is merit in the more traditional, smaller, suboptimal systems design approach. Such systems are relatively economical, quickly imple-mented, and easier to design and manage. In either case, since the technology permits " distrib-uting " large amounts of computing facilities in small packages to remote locations, some kind of structure (or architecture) is imperative because decentraliza-tion without structure is chaos. Therefore, to keep the business from disintegrating, the concept of in-formation systems architecture is becoming less an option and more a necessity for establishing some order and control in the investment of information systems resources. The cost involved and the success of the business depending increasingly on its infor-mation systems require a disciplined approach to the management of those systems.},

In this chapter, we discuss the foundations of an ontological-based architecture for organizing information and knowledge within corporations. Our research focus on three main eforts: (i) to shed some light on the ontological status of corporations, (ii) to understand the relations between corporate units, and (iii) to approach the duties that corporations have to manage. After presenting background theories, we analyze the corporation through two dimensions, namely, a descriptive and a normative. While the former approaches the structure of the corporation from the point of view of its units, the later approaches it from the point of view of duties and obligations. The descriptive side of our investigation is conducted through principles of top-level formal ontologies; the normative side is addressed through the so-called social ontology. The relevance of developing such analysis rests on the need of a beter understanding of corporations, its structures, and its activities. Such insight can provide a formal framework suitable to be applied in information systems, working in the context of modern technologies like the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {What is a model? What is a metamodel? What is a language? What is a transformation? How are these concepts related? It is striking to see that, though MDE is supposed to be about precise modelling, MDE core concepts are usually described in natural language or at best, using sketchy "{\`{a}}-la" UML diagrams. These diagrams are very often inconsistent and too vague to reason about. Most of the time, they are neither validated, not even used by their authors. When precise descriptions are provided, it is only to describe a specific technology. But since Model Driven Engineering is a about supporting multiple Technological Spaces (TS), the concepts of model, metamodel, and transformation should be declined, not only in the MDA TS, but also in the Grammarware TS, Documentware TS, Dataware TS, etc. To cope with these prob- lems, we decided to start research on defining a megamodel of MDE. This paper shown how the set theory and language theory could help in understanding MDE concepts and their relationships. The megamodel could also be seen as a first version of a rudimentary theory for reasoning about MDE concepts.},

@article{Kuhne2006,
abstract = {Abstract With the recent trend to model driven engineering a common understanding of basic notions such as model and metamodel becomes a pivotal issue. Even though these notions have been in widespread use for quite a while, there is still little consensus about when exactly it is appropriate to use them. The aim of this article is to start establishing a consensus about generally acceptable terminology. Its main contributions are the distinction between two fundamentally different kinds of model roles, i.e. token model versus type model (The terms type and token have been introduced by C.S. Peirce, 18391914.), a formal notion of metaness, and the consideration of generalization as yet another basic relationship between models. In particular, the recognition of the fundamental difference between the above mentioned two kinds of model roles is crucial in order to enable communication among the model driven engineering community that is free of both unnoticed misunderstandings and unnecessary disagreement.},

In this paper we argue that ontological concerns should be clearly separated from information modeling concerns. We have observed that ontology-based approaches and information modeling approaches have been treated mostly in isolation, with the consequence that the relation between a domain ontology and an information model is still in need of clarification, despite the efforts of the formal ontology and information modeling communities. We strive to provide the initial steps for a principled two-level approach in which a domain ontology addressing ontological concerns is used as a starting point for the definition of an information model, according to a certain information demand.

abstract = {"Language is the most important of all the instruments of civilization." The authors state this premise boldly in their preface to "The Meaning of Meaning," a classic work whose significance--and challenge--to the study of language, literature, and philosophy has remained undiminished since its original publication. Much about language continues to be only hazily understood, distorted by our habitual attitude--often one of indifference--toward words, or by lingering assumptions based on discredited theories. What IS the relationship between words and what the words refer to? Between words and the way we think? Can understanding such matters lead to greater precision in communication? Readers considering these questions find themselves at the crossroads of linguistics and communications theory, of literary criticism and philosophy--an interdisciplinary nexus claimed by the increasingly influential field of semiotics--and "The Meaning of Meaning" will prove, as it has over the last six decades, an essential resource.},

Therefore, in this thesis, we analyze conceptual modeling in terms of two levels, namely, the so-called ontological level and, what we call, the information level. Our initial effort is to characterize the information level in harmony with existing works on information modeling and to align our information level approach with the existing ones concerning the ontological level. Then, we strive to provide a model-driven approach in which a domain ontology addressing ontological concerns (at the ontological level) is used as a starting point for the definition of an information model addressing informational concerns (at the information level). Our model-driven approach is guided by several systematic informational decisions that we identify here, which assist the addressing of an information demand. We adopt a philosophically well-founded profile of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams, called OntoUML, to represent domain ontologies. Further, we adopt UML class diagrams to represent information models in an object-oriented approach. Finally, we provide tool support for the model transformation from OntoUML to UML in order to operationalize the approach and show its technical feasibility.},

@book{Henderson-Sellers2012,
abstract = {"Computing as a discipline is maturing rapidly. However, with maturity often comes a plethora of subdisciplines, which, as time progresses, can become isolationist. The subdisciplines of modelling, metamodelling, ontologies and modelling languages within software engineering e.g. have, to some degree, evolved separately and without any underpinning formalisms. Introducing set theory as a consistent underlying formalism, Brian Henderson-Sellers shows how a coherent framework can be developed that clearly links these four, previously separate, areas of software engineering. In particular, he shows how the incorporation of a foundational ontology can be beneficial in resolving a number of controversial issues in conceptual modelling, especially with regard to the perceived differences between linguistic metamodelling and ontological metamodelling. An explicit consideration of domain-specific modelling languages is also included in his mathematical analysis of models, metamodels, ontologies and modelling languages. This encompassing and detailed presentation of the state-of-the-art in modelling approaches mainly aims at researchers in academia and industry. They will find the principled discussion of the various subdisciplines extremely useful, and they may exploit the unifying approach as a starting point for future research."--Publisher's website. 1Introduction -- Mathematics for Modelling -- Models -- Metamodels -- Ontologies -- Modelling Languages -- Linking Models, Metamodels, Ontologies and Modelling Languages -- Other Related Work and Further Discussion -- Conclusions and Further Work.},

Thus, one of the questions which are addressed here is: how can we assess the ontology adequacy of a given modeling language? In simple terms, ontological adequacy is a measure of how close the models produced using a modeling language are to the situations in reality they are supposed to represent. In this thesis, we show how modeling languages can be evaluated and (re)designed with the purpose of improving their ontological adequacy, by proposing a systematic evaluation method for comparing a metamodel of the concepts underlying a language to a reference ontology of the corresponding domain in reality.},

@inproceedings{Atkinson2011,
abstract = {As an alternative modeling infrastructure and paradigm, multi-level modeling addresses many of the conceptual weaknesses found in the four level modeling infrastructure that underpins traditional modeling approaches like UML and EMF. It does this by explicitly distinguishing between linguistic and ontological forms of classification and by allowing the influence of classifiers to extend over more than one level of instantiation. Multi-level modeling is consequently starting to receive attention from a growing number of research groups. However, there has never been a concrete definition of a language designed from the ground-up for the specific purpose of representing multi-level models. Some authors have informally defined the ``look and feel'' of such a language, but to date there has been no systematic or fully elaborated definition of its concrete syntax. In this paper we address this problem by introducing the key elements of a language, known as the Level-Agnostic Modeling Language (LML) designed to support multi-level modeling.},

abstract = {Ontology, in its original philosophical sense, is a fundamental branch of metaphysics focusing on the study of existence; its objective is to determine what entities and types of entities actually exist and thus to study the structure of the world. In contrast, in computer science an ontology is an engineering artifact, usually a “conceptual model” of (some aspect of) the world, typically formalised as a logical theory. Formalising an ontology using a suitable logic opens up the possibility of using automated reasoning to support both ontology design and deployment. The value of such support has already been demonstrated in medical applications, where it has been used to help repair and enrich ontologies that play an important role in patient care.Even with the aid of reasoning enabled tools, developing and maintaining good quality ontologies is a difficult and costly task, and problems related to the availability of good quality ontologies threaten to limit the deployment of ontology-based information systems. This has resulted in ontology engineers increasingly looking to the philosophy community for possible solutions, and in particular as a source of relevant expertise in the organisation and formalisation of knowledge.},
