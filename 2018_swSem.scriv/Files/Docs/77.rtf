\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Contemporary software architectures apply many models that collectively represent the software agent. We concluded that one of them, the conceptual model, is a backward-looking (descriptive) model. However, many if not all of the other models that are applied are forward-looking (system) models, prescribing the structure and behaviour of the software agent as such. Indeed, by definition of being forward-looking, the models can and will be verified towards their meta-model. Such verification, however, is only in respect to their syntactical formulation, whereas their meaning should be sought in their relation with the conceptual model. Thus, supporting a semantic verification of the system models demands a clear formal characterisation of the relations with their conceptual model, which is the subject of this Section. We start with a small semiotic introductory about linking semiotic triangles together, and then elaborate on the relations that exist internal to the ASM before diving into the relations that apply between the ASM and the forward-looking (system) models.}}
