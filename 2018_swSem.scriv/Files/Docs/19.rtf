\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   *Context:* Access-and-Play semantic interoperability (sIOP) is the next glass ceiling in IT-based business collaboration. Current approaches towards sIOP rely on conventions on the semantics of the exchanged terms, which can be considered accepted folklore. Approaches to break through the ceiling require some level of automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) can make a difference.       }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0     }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   *Objective:* The objective of this study is to identify and define AI-based fundamental guidance towards access-and-play sIOP in contemporary architectural paradigms.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   *Method:* Our approach is based on the discipline of semiotics. We identify semiotic shortcomings in architectures, establish a semiotic explanation on software semantics and, subsequently, on sIOP. Based on these considerations, we develop guiding architectural principles in support of software semantics and sIOP. We evaluate these principles by designing and formulating an ISO-42010 Architecture Viewpoint and View on sIOP.   }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   *Results:* The semiotic approach demonstrates semantics in software to be the result of a reciprocity between data and the software code that operates on them. Data exchange breaks that reciprocity and the main concern of sIOP is to re-establish a valid reciprocity. Loosely coupled semantics, semantic alignments and an ontological commitment of the modelling language can be considered the cornerstone to achieve sIOP. }{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5F85E3A6-79B6-43F9-9283-19EFC7E6D74C"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The supporting}}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  principles are (i) semantic transparency, (ii) semantic separation of concerns, and (iii) explicit computational semantics. The resulting ISO-42010 Architecture Viewpoint and View on sIOP, including a semantic mediation capability, can be considered a pattern to consolidate sIOP in contemporary architectural paradigms.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0   *Conclusions:* The major shortcomings in architectural paradigms to account for sIOP are their negligence of semiotic fundamentals and the absence of an explicit ontological commitment that stands at the root of semantics. By their explicit inclusion, access-and-play sIOP can be consolidated in contemporary architectural paradigms.   }
