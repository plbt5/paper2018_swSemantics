Purpose of this section: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Show the semantic architecture as an additional layer that is orthogonal to current layers, expressing a separation of concerns between syntax and semantics (see \cite{Brandt:2013jh})
\item Define loosely coupled semantics as a result of applying the 2 principles 'semantic separation of concerns' and 'semantic transparency' (see \cite{Brandt:2013jh})
\item Better structure informal text below, towards more Principle definitions.
\end{itemize}
