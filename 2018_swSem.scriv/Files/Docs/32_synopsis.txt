Purpose of this section: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Show the semantic architecture as an additional layer that is orthogonal to current layers, expressing a separation of concerns between syntax and semantics (see [@Brandt:2013jh])
\item Define loosely coupled semantics as a result of applying the 2 principles 'semantic separation of concerns' and 'semantic transparency' (see [@Brandt:2013jh])
\item Repeat the Coherence Principle, the sIOP Coherence Principle, and the Ontological Commitment Principle, and show how they fit in the semantic architecture
\item Better structure informal text below, towards more Principle definitions.
\end{itemize}
