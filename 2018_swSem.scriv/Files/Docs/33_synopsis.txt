Consolidate the ideas on the bridgehead, spanning, roadway and principles into an additional ISO42010 Architectural Viewpoint (sIOP) that summarises all previous Sections as concerns on semantics and sIOP.

I presume we will introduce a Semantic Viewpoint with its Semantic View. Currently, an Information Viewpoint and View exists; how do we relate to that? Do we extend it into the Semantic versions of it, or, do we provide a formal Correspondence with it? Tha latter has the opportunity to be backwards compatible, and inhere on its integration with the rest of the views/models; the former might better reflect a single concern as opposed to splitting the concern in two (semantic vs information).

View Correspondences and Viewpont Correspondence Rules can be used to implement the aspects addressed in Section Architectural Consistency.
