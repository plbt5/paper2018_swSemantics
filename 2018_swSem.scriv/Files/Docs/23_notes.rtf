\par\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We distinguish two types of definitions for the conceptualisation: by extension and by intension. An }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 extensional definition}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  explicitly }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 lists}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  all elements that are considered to be contained by the definition. This results in a mathematical set that includes all the elements for which the definition holds }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 by definition}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , and excludes those elements that do not take part in the definition. Consequently, this works for finite sets only. Contrarily, an }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 intensional definition}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  is based on the formulation of a criterion that }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 produces}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the set. In order to define an infinite set one requires an intensional definition. }
