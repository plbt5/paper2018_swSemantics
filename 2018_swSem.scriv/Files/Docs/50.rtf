\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 1. Allow for independent software development, i.e., sIOP demands \line 1. a software capability that is open for collaboration, i.e., without a prior established semantic silo. \line 2. an ad-hoc collaboration, i.e., without additional software development for its achievement, i.e., reverse engineering of the semantic silo.\line 2. We assume that strong AI, i.e., software that has some form of understanding about reality, will not emerge in the near future, hence, weak AI is all we have (i.e., logic and statistics). Software is therefore 100% dependent on syntax as vehicle for semantics. That inevitably leads to a human in the loop when sIOP is demanded. To get as close to the access-and-play performance of sIOP as possible, the human effort needs to be as small as possible, and out of the actual data communication process.}}
