\pard\plain \ri-16872\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once we have established a conceptualisation, it needs a representation because, despite being a mathematical representation, the sets and individuals in the DoI remain nameless. It is necessary to represent them in a (pair of) model(s) that is tangible, computational and as accurate as necessary in order for the software agent to use it and, eventually, make comparisons with the semantic artifact of the peer software agent. The model that describes semantics best is a model that is as faithful to reality as possible. This begs the question about the nature of a conceptual model at the one hand, and that of faithfulness at th other, which will be addressed in the next two sections. The final section will discuss how to attain one single semantic reference, necessary to establish explicit coherence between the models that are contained in a semantic monolith. }
