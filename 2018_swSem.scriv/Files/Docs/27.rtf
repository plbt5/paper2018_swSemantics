\pard\plain \ri-16872\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once we have established a conceptualisation, it needs a representation because, despite being a mathematical representation, the sets and individuals in the DoI remain nameless. It is necessary to represent them in a (pair of) model(s) that is tangible, computational and as accurate as necessary in order for the software agent to use it and, eventually, make comparisons with the semantic artifact of the peer software agent. The model that describes semantics best is a model that is as faithful to reality as possible. This begs the question about the nature of a conceptual model on the one hand, which is addressed in the last subsection, and that of faithfulness on the other, which is the subject of the next subsection. }
