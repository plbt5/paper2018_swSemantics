\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A (modelling) language is used to convey }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 distinctions}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . The predominant purpose of modelling is to describe (a particular domain in) reality by distinguishing the entities of interest. The distinctions that are already articulated by the elementary language constructs define the expressiveness of that language; the more distinctions the language elements can convey, the more differences can be represented by that language. The (fundamental) categories that the language elements can discern apply during modelling as a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 commitment}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , e.g., does the language commit to the intuitive difference between the cup and the coffee that it holds, or not? If it does, then in this example the language has one element that carries the elementary characteristic of liquidness, and another that shows the fundamental aspects of a substantial that you can hold and is the integrated whole of its subparts. The latter cannot function without all its subparts, like the cup that cannot be split in two, while the former maintains its fluidness no matter how often it is divided into or merged with other liquids. When the language does not provide such distinctions, it does not commit to the existence of those things in reality, e.g., substantials like the cup and liquidness such as coffee. Consequently, the user of the language is forced to specify the distinction in the model and, subsequently, create code to act upon those distinctions! Whereas domain analysts create models to represents the distinctions that the domain users deem relevant to consider in their domain, in philosophy [@Bricker2016], similar questions are asked but that relate to \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93life, the universe and everything\u8221\'94 as opposed to a single domain of application. What }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 kind}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  of entities exist? Are the universal aspects that seem to be shared between individual entities, e.g., weight, taken to be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 sui generis}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ? These are questions \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93(...) not in order to know *what there is*, but in order to know what a given remark or doctrine, ours or someone else\u8217\'92s, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 says}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  there is\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 [@Quine:1953er]. What kinds of entity exist }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 according to a given theory or discourse}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ? This is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 meta-ontology}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  and the answers provide a generic framework of distinction that represents a useful meta-model to the domain analyst, denoted the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 foundational ontology}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ^[also known as a top-level ontology or an upper ontology, but not here]. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The distinctions that are articulated by a language are denoted as its }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 ontological commitment}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 .}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That the ontological commitment is relevant for an architecture that deals with semantics is clear when we state that every language carries an ontological commitment at least implicitly. This follows directly from the fact that a modelling language will convey distinctions; every type of (linguistic or graphical) element will represent something else, and rules constrain the way element types can be combined. No matter the semantic neutrality (or not) of the ontological distinctions, implicit distinctions can only result in a model that carries semantics with suboptimal accuracy at best, but probably will represent semantic incoherences. Therefore, explicitly introducing the ontological commitment of the modelling language is necessary to control the semantic accuracy of the model.     }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Aristotle already suggested two orthogonal distinctions to categorise things: that between }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 types}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  (a.k.a. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Universals}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ) and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 individuals}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  (a.k.a. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Particulars}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ); and that between }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 characteristics}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  (a.k.a. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Qualities}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  or properties) and their bearing substrates: }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 substantials}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  (a.k.a. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Endurants}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ), depicted in \\cref\{fig:onto-square-and-sextet\}(a) with their causal relations. This scheme, denoted by [@Angelelli1967] as the *ontological square*, can be considered the most basic ontological commitment when acknowledged by a modelling language [@Lowe2006]. Its extension into the ontological sextet [@Smith2005] is just to acknowledge that at some point the influence of time should be incorporated as \tab another independent dimension, entailing }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 events}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  (or }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Perdurants}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ) (\\cref\{fig:onto-square-and-sextet\}(b)). Clearly, similar formal distinctions can be observed in contemporary modelling paradigms at their uppermost meta-level: OMG\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s MOF pyramid distinguishes between the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Association}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  and the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Class}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  at its top level M3, whereas the Resource Description Framework\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s language distinguishes primarily between a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 subject}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , an }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 object}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , and a directed }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 property}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  relation between them. All these meta-meta-models are very generic as their intention is to be applicable as a modelling language under virtually all circumstances. Unfortunately, being very generic implies that their use as ontological commitment, viz. their capability as a language to convey differences, is rather limited as well. For all examples above, it is impossible to differentiate, for example, between the cup and the coffee that it holds, while intuitively, these are not only very different from each other but including these distinctions does not limit its generic applicability as a language. The more extended an ontological commitment becomes, the more it can distinguish (as a language) between things that we are interested in. Despite the various flavours in foundational ontologies, we demand that such foundation provides for two mechanisms: Firstly, we are in need of a *principle of application*, a mechanism in accordance with which we can judge whether an individual belongs to a certain type (universal) or not; we should be able to give appropriate answers to questions such as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is Yojo a cat?\u8221\'94 This is not only relevant in order to classify individuals, but also to understand the characteristics of the *instantiation* relation between types and individuals (addressed in \\cref\{relations\}). Secondly, we are in need of a *principle of identity*, a mechanism to make a distinction between two individuals (particulars). Such principle must go beyond provisioning a unique label since such essentially represents, as we have seen, just a random token; in stead, we should be able to give appropriate answers to questions such as \u8220\'93Is Yojo *my* cat?\u8221\'94 For that, we are in a need for a discerning principle. Indeed such can *not* be found in the nature of things, since Quine\u8217\'92s remark above clearly identifies the need for a doctrine that determines the criterion for, here, identity. Hence the demand for the ability to specify a social convention about the principle of identity that is applied.  }

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The ontological sextet has been specialised into several flavours, called foundational ontologies, e.g., UFO [@Guizzardi:2015ky], GFO [@Herre2010], SUMO [@Niles:2001], YAMAYATO [@Mizoguchi:2010vv], BFO [@Grenon2004], DOLCE [@Masolo2002] and more, and with their similarities and differences between them [@Jansen2008]. Not all of them are intended to provide for a complete foundation as UFO, GFO and BFO do; several are primarily developed for facilitating particular philosophical theories (DOLCE), others (YAMAYATO, SUMO) are the result of research into mentioned theories. No matter the reason for their existence, they all assume a certain philosophical viewpoint with the purpose to accurately describe categories that exist in reality according to their viewpoint. We consider this the *philosophical cornerstone* that is required to produce semantics that are faithful to reality. We thus defend that the semantic validity of any proposition can only be assessed if and only if the underlying ontological commitment can be referred to. Furthermore, any assessment towards semantic interoperability of two semantic theories cannot be made without an assessment of the similarity between their underlying ontological commitments. Following our statement that every modelling language will carry an ontological commitment, it then remains the responsibility of the (domain) analyst to select the viewpoint that is most appropriate for its purpose, in order to select the modelling language that describes the types of things that exist in the domain of application the most accurate.}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As indicated in \\cref\{fig:semiotic-triangles\}(b), we equate faithfulness with trueness between the representation and the entity in reality. Since this aspect is a characteristic of an indirect relationship, it can only emerge as a result of the adequacy and correctness characteristics in that same figure. Adequacy concerns the quality of the abstraction, which we do not address here. Correctness concerns the quality of the representation. In literature, four construct issues are considered between a conceptualisation and its representation in a model, depicted in \\cref\{fig:construct-issues\}. An exhaustive treatment can be found in [@Guizzardi:2005vt], see also [@CarvalhoeSilva2012; or @Azevedo2015]. The correctness with which tokens represent the conceptualisation improves when the four construct issues are minimised. The best representation of a conceptualisation, then, is a model that is lucid, sound, laconic and complete, i.e., the subjectivation/representation mapping is isomorphic [@Guizzardi:2005vt]^[This is in clear contrast with the relationship between concepts in the data model and concepts in their data processing model that was discussed in \\cref\{enforcing-coherence\}. In terms of construct issues, that relationship allows construct overload and construct redundancy.]. This strongly depends on the modelling language, and particularly its appropriateness with which it carves-out the reality of the DoI, viz. the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93ontological level\u8221\'94 [@Guarino1994b], our \u8220\'93terminological competence [that] can be gained by formally expressing the ontological commitment of a knowledge base\u8221\'94 (ibid.).}
