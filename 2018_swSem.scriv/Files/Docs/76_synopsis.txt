Explain: difference between ontologies and models:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Models lack an elaborate ontological commitment, domain ontologies naturally evolve on foundational ontologies (that express an ontological commitment)
 \item ~~For prescriptive models, truth lies in meta-models~~ (good for deterministic behaviour); ~~ontologies are descriptive models for which the truth lies in reality~~ (good for semantics)
 \item ~~ontologies have open world assumption (semantic under-specification), models have closed world assumption (data remain consistent, good for performance)~~
 \item ~~Models specify systems, ontologies conceptualise reality (entities)~~ 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Try to also connect the onto/model distinction with above principles 
  \item Induced problem: from OWA (domain ontologies) to CWA (information/data models), viz. how to get closure?
  \item Principle: use domain and business ontologies for “computational independent”-ish models [@Aßmann2006]
  \item Bridge descriptive --> prescriptive models by grounding all prescriptive model elements with concepts from descriptive model (see e.g. \cref{fig:OntosInMDE}).
 \end{itemize}
 \item Different aggregation levels of ASM: vocabuaries as semantic standard vs. single elements
\end{enumerate}
