Elaborate on the relationship between architectural levels (classification, instantiation, generalisation, conformance, type-of), and specify what relations are required and appropriate and what not.

Conclusions:

* Conceptual models address/support functional requirements; prescriptive models address/support extra-functional requirements;
* Prescriptive models shall maintain coherence in ASM as established by the conceptual model, hence, do not alter their reciprocity; This also implies that the relationships that are appled by the prescriptive models are grounded in the conceptual model;
* Ontological instantiation (principle of application) is preserved for conceptual model only and prohibited for prescritive models;
* Summarise outcomes on relations between and within layers
