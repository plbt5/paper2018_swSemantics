\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ![Infinite regress in semantics: background knowledge is yet another conceptualization (denoted *I*) that requires a token (*R*) to communicate, the interpretation of which requires another conceptualization albeit on a higher conceptual level.](https://i.imgur.com/eFy5pg4.png)\line \line }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The corollary of such semiotic stance is of architectural nature: what are its ramifications on the dependencies between software, data, software engineering and business operations? How can contemporary weak AI technologies such as the Semantic Web, ontologies and model driven architectures, contribute to sIOP and what place should they get in the overall software architecture? To what extend can architectural patterns and techniques, such as abstraction and loose coupling, contribute to its realization, and where do they fall short and what is missing, exactly?\line \line }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before we dive into these architectural considerations, we first present the limitations of current approaches towards sIOP.\line }

This implies that M3 is grounded in model engineering conventions only and neglects any semiotic significance in reality. As a result, each and every artefact that is introduced in any of the other layers, has a dangling semiotic foundation. This implies that every modeling artefact can respond equally well to conflicting characteristics, and hence, cannot provide for any guidance on its interpretation.\line * Semantic conventions, e.g., standards. Conventions, though, are only possible when their subject has been made explicit.}}
