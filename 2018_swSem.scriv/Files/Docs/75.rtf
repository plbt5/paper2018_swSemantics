\pard\plain \ri-16872\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To start with the latter and as indicated in \\cref\{fig:semiotic-triangles\}(b), we equate faithfulness with trueness between the representation and the entity in reality. Since this aspect is a characteristic of an indirect relationship, it can only emerge as a result of the adequacy and correctness characteristics in that same Figure. Adequacy concerns the quality of the abstraction, which we do not address here. Correctness concerns the quality of the representation, and in this section we show how differences can emerge between the conceptualisation and the model when constructing the latter from the former.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \\item The more specific the ontological commitment gets, the higher its complexity which might even turn into a NP-complexity;}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \\item The ability of a software agent for semantic interoperability increases with the domain appropriateness of the domain model;}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \\item The achieved semantic interoperability for a pair of agents depends highly on the correspondence between the ontological commitments of their domain models;}
