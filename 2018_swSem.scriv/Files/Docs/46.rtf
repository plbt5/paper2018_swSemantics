\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 > Indeed, to achieve sIOP both collaborating partners must share something that extends beyond the domain of application. The higher this shared abstraction, the more generic the sIOP capability. \line \line }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 - [INSERT notion on communication between two actors about a shared reality] \line - [INSERT notion that each application is about its own domain]\line - [INSERT notion that sIOP is only possible when the domains of application of both software components have some overlap; they do not need to have identical domains of application, nor do they need to have identical levels of aggregation etc.]\line - [INSERT notion that the business concern on sIOP is about its ad-hoc capability, e.g., process anything published by anybody anytime and anywhere. Implies that only the reality is shared, and not its conceptualization nor its representation]\line - Semantic interoperability, then, denotes the capability of software to process external data in such a particular way that its semantics is in accordance with the state of affairs about its domain of application.\line - [INSERT the notion that sIOP is in essence independent on the way that it is realized. However, the usefulness of establishing sIOP *is* related to extra-functionals with which it can be established, ideally as access-and-play capability.]\line \line }
