\pard\plain \ri-16872\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This shows how the cognitive quality of the conceptualisation could be substituted with a formulation in set theory. The resulting conceptual model essentially remains a representation, albeit a mathematical one. One can argue that such substitution does not resolve the grounding problem, and appropriately so. Still, mathematics provides for a very exact way to express oneself, reducing the ambiguity that comes implicitly with any other language. Furthermore, logical constructs used at the syntactical level can be interpreted into set theoretic operations, facilitating the evaluation of complicated expressions. And thanks to mathematics we can also indicate the exact issues that exist with conceptual modelling, depicted in \\cref\{fig:4-model-construct-issues\}.}

\par\pard\plain \ri-16872\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The triadic model is more suitable to explain the differences between human semantics and semantics in computers, by identifying the semiotic differences between the two as follows. Since humans are capable of making observations from reality, and abstract these into conceptualisations, there is a direct connection between the entity and the conceptualisation. Computers lack that capability, as depicted in \\cref\{fig:semiotic-differences\}. Here, we show the semiotic differences between semantics as they appear for human actors, part (a) of the Figure, and that of software actors in part (b). The comparison is made from the perspective of communication, e.g., how is reality signified into utterances made by the actor, and vice versa, how are utterances signified into what they stand for in reality. We can assume the entity to remain identical over both actors, and the token to remain equivalent to the extent that in terms of computers these are referred to as *data*. The third node, representing the conceptualisation for human agents, for software agents we claim to denote that as the application. Although in its bare form an application is nothing more than tokens that follow a specific language grammar, this bare form is only a representation of its quintessence, i.e., a run-time notion on how to act on the receipt of data.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 However, because computers are unable to conceptualise or concretize, the connection between the software\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s conceptualisation and the entity does not exist. This \u8220\'93missing link\u8221\'94 in artificial intelligence is called *the grounding problem*, named after the inability to ground a conceptualisation in what it refers to in reality. In literature, two exceptions to this rule exist, which we discuss in the box text below. Our stance towards these exceptions is that they are interesting, however currently irrelevant towards the resolution of semantic interoperability due to their many practical shortcomings in implementing an actual connection between the entity and the conceptualisation. }

The same question however about, e.g., its scalability, will render a lecture with adequate references to the underlying architecture. We thus remain at a loss of how to engineer semantics into software agents. However, without a clear understanding on semantics and its contribution to the software agent, we are lacking the bridgehead within the software agent that is fundamental to the semantic interoperability bridge. }
