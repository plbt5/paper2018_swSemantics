\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once we establish a conceptualisation, it needs a representation because, despite being a mathematical representation, the sets and individuals in the DoI remain nameless. They need to be represented in a (pair of) model(s) that is tangible, computational and accurate for the software agent to use it and make comparisons with incoming data. This representation should be as faithful to reality as possible, for which we investigate the nature of a conceptual model, \\cref\{the-nature-of-models\}, and that of faithfulness, \\cref\{ontological-commitment\}.}}
