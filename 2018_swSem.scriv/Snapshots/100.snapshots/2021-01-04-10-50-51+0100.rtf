\pard\plain \ri-17654\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We summarise the semiotic and pragmatic concern as follow. Semantics denotes the indirect relationship that exists between the token and the entity as well as how we comprehend that relationship against our own frame of reference. In software, semantics is reduced to the reciprocity between data and software code. Valid reciprocity is realised by maintaining the coherence, as pairs, between data and data processing theories. Coherence is enforced by (i) applying formal semantics to formulate a particular subjective conceptualisation as the DoI that forms the reference model for the interpretation functions from the conceptual model, and by (ii) maintaining a bijective mapping within the conceptual model between the concepts used in the semantic model and those from the pragmatic model, and vice versa. We constrain to the traditional and formal relationship of interpretation between the software representation of the conceptual model and the set theoretic representation of the reference model.}
