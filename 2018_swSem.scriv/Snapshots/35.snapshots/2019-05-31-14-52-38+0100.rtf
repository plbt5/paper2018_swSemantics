\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The notion on semantic coherence can be seen in object-orientation (OO) as well, where the class can be seen as a construct similar to a semantic monolith. Indeed, OO does a very good job at enforcing a reciprocity between data and data operations. However, as a model OO can only provide for an informal \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93representation\u8221\'94 relation with reality as depicted in \\cref\{fig:software-models-reality\} due to the absence of a formal underlying framework and, henceforth, absence of a formal DoI. As we will see in \\cref\{explicit-semantics\}, OO makes a good instrument for maintaining coherence, but cannot represent semantics explicitly. }
